I am cleaning an agricultural Q&A dataset and need your help to determine if the expert's answer is satisfactory. If the expert's answer is unsatisfactory, such as suggesting to contact someone else, asking for more information, indicating uncertainty, admitting they cannot help, or if the answer contains links or mentions that there is a link here, output {"satisfactory": False}. Otherwise, output {"satisfactory": True}. 
Here are some examples to help you understand the task better:

<Example1: suggesting to contact someone else>
Expert's Answer:
Good morning Dave,  Thank you for contacting AnswerLine. I would recommend contacting the Linn County Master Gardeners for assistance with your question. They can be reached at <personal data hidden> or their Hortline at<personal data hidden> (Monday - Thursday from 10AM-12PM).'

<Example2: links in the answer "txsmartscape.com">
Expert's Answer:
What you are seeing is called Horseherb, Calyptocarpus vialis. This plant is a groundcover that is getting attention as a sustainable lawn. I am attaching a few links that will give you information concerning this plant and how to kill it if you want.

<Example3: indicating uncertainty>
Expert's Answer:
We can not tell for sure from your photos what your issue is. Possibilities include wildlife burrowing and stormwater issues.
Judgement: 
{"satisfactory": False}
<Example3>

<Example4: No links but mention a link exists "Here is a link">
Expert's Answer:
What is your plant? It looks like it could be some kind of Aloe. It's fairly close to a plant called Partridge Breast Aloe. It flowers with tall red/orange flowers from the top. Here is a link to some more info about the Partridge Breast Aloe.
Judgement: 
{"satisfactory": False}

<Example5: No links but mention a link exists "Please open the drop down boxes">
Expert's Answer:
I believe that is early Black Knot. Please open the drop down boxes in this link to deal with it ASAP. Black knot | UMN Extension
Judgement: 
{"satisfactory": False}
<Example5>

<Example6: No links but mention a link exists "Here is more information about apple scab">
Expert's Answer:
If you compost be sure your compost reaches temperatures that kill fungi and weed seeds. If not, sending your yard waste to a city processor is the better option. Here is more information about apple scab. Good luck!
Judgement: 
{"satisfactory": False}
<Example5>

<Example7: Ask for more information "take another picture and send it in">
Expert's Answer:
It may not be anything to worry about. Just keep an eye on them. If you notice adult insects and they feed on the leaves of the wild rose, take another picture and send it in. Then we'll have a better idea if you need to use an insecticide or not.
Judgement:
{"satisfactory": False}
<Example7>

<Example8: Ask for more information "bring an 18-inch sample">
Expert's Answer:
Thank you for your question. For the best identification of your problem, bring an 18-inch sample (1/2 diseased & 1/2 healthy) of your tree for our tree team to accurately identify. Your pictures possibly depict fire blight, which is running rampant in the area.
Judgement:

<Example9: Satisfactory answer>
Expert's Answer:
Greetings, This fungus is Phaeolus schweinitzii, the "dyers polypore," so-called because it is used as a dyestuff by crafters.Â  It is not edible.

# Not enough information to determine what's wrong with your tree. Part of the damage looks new, yet there appears to be rough irregular damaged bark already present.

# Expert's Answer:
# Hi - I really can't tell what is wrong just from the picture. If the plant is wilting, it might be a root rot disease. We did get a lot of rain last year and through the winter. If it is a root rot disease, there is not much you can do except dig the plant out and replace it with a different species. If you want to confirm that this is the problem, you can send a sample to the UConn Plant Diagnostic Lab (<Link 1>) where they can culture your plant for diseases. Contact them first to see how you would submit a sample.
