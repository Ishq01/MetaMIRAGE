Title: Invasive grass flower
User Question: This small white flower invades the grass and multiplies and takes over the grass. It flowered in May but now in June stopped flowering. It roots are like a sweet potatoes and difficult to remove, you need to dig it up making your lawn look patchy.
Expert Answer: The weed you are trying to rid your lawn of is pennywort (Hydrocotyle americana, sometimes also known as dollarweed. It spreads by seed and by underground rhizomes and is a perennial that blooms early. It thrives in moist areas. The best way to control this broadleaf weed is to maintain a healthy lawn by regularly mowing at the recommended height for your variety of grass and watering deeply and infrequently to encourage deeper root growth. Monitor your lawn for areas that may need improved soil drainage. Fertilize your lawn appropriately; as recommended for your type of grass. Remove the weeds you presently have by hand pulling making sure to remove all roots. If your infestation is too broad to control by cultural methods, chemical control options are available. Use a herbicide designed to target this specific type of weed. Your local nursery operator can help you select the most effective application. When using any chemical read the label thoroughly and follow the instructions provided regarding the proper use and disposal Thank you for your question.

Title: Is this horsenettle?
User Question: I am thinking that the attached photo is of horsenettle. Is that correct? I would prefer not to use any chemicals, but are there other ways to remove it premanently? It has such a long tap root when I try to dif it up.
Expert Answer: It does look like Carolina Horsenettle (Solanum carolinense), though flowers (or if it stuck around long enough, \
fruits) would help to confirm the ID. It is native, but considered a weed in garden and agricultural settings. \ 
Either systemic herbicide to kill the roots or vigilant physical removal would be needed to eradicate it. If you \
wish to avoid herbicide, then dig up (or cut down) what you can, and remove any regrowth as quickly as it \
appears. Eventually, this will starve the roots of stored energy, and the plant(s) will stop regrowing. How long \
this process takes is hard to predict, but it might be several months at least if the plant(s) is well- \
established or mature. Even herbicide might take more than one application to be successful. Miri

Title: Household flying insect identification
User Question: Can you please identify this insect? A number of these showed up in my kitchen a few days ago. I have killed about 10 of them, but they continue to emerge. Iâ€™d like to know where they most likely come from and how I can get rid of them.
Expert Answer: This looks like a Sunflower Seed Maggot Fly (Neotephritis finalis), a native insect widespread in North America. The larvae feed in immature seeds of many plants in the aster family (sunflowers being one of them). If you have raw sunflower seeds that weren't heat-treated or otherwise processed to kill insects, or are saving native plant seeds for propagation, perhaps that's where the population is coming from. These flies are not a typical household pest, so should not be a recurring problem if you can find the seeds they are breeding in and either remove them or seal their container.

Title: Cherry Laurel
User Question: I have a stand of cherry laurels and one of the bushes has a white covering all over its bark. There are some dead branches on this particular bush. Can you tell me what it is and whether/how to treat it?
Expert Answer: That is called White Prunicola Scale and it is a common pest of Cherry Laurel. It is advisable to prune out the dead and heavily infected branches. Throughout the year, you can treat with an insecticidal soap or horticultural oil during the crawler emergence periods to help smother the nymphs. Once they take on the adult form and grow a protective coat, it becomes difficult to treat them, so manual removal such as scrubbing them off the branches or further pruning may be necessary. Let us know if you have further questions with treatment.

Title: Veggie plant disease, affect on soil and compost for next year
Question: Hello! I am growing butternut squash (among other things) that have white spots and dying leaves. I also have tomatoes that have brown spots on yellow leaves (potentially early blight). Can I use this soil next year? It's in raised beds, and I really don't want to replace all of that soil. I also don't have too much space to rotate where I put things. I have tomatoes in different spots all over the garden beds. Additionally, before I realized about the white spots on the squash, I placed some leaves in my compost bin. It's a self-contained bin that I turn about once a week. Do I need to throw away the compost? What if I wait until next year to use it?
Answer: Early blight and powdery mildew can overwinter in the soil and on plant debris. Composting does not eliminate these pathogens. Ideally, crop rotation would be recommended. I would not use the compost containing the infected squash leaves in the garden. Early blight and powdery mildew are host specific, so the compost can be used around ornamental plants. If crop rotation and soil replacement are not an option, consider treating aggressively with fungicides at 7-day intervals next season after the crops are transplanted or emerged from the soil. Both diseases can migrate into the site on windborne spores, so even with crop rotation, soil replacement, and alternative compost uses, you could still see infection. Fungicide use is critical. If you wish to stay organic, consider organically approved fixed copper fungicides or biofungicides like Serenade, Regalia, or Double Nickel 55.

Title: tomatos got problems
Question: Could you please tell me what's going wrong with my tomato plants? They are in big lots with lots of sun. Why are the leaves covered with brown spots and turning brown?
Answer: Why are your tomato leaves turning brown? It doesn't look like the brown patches are covering too many of the leaves. It could be a reaction to the cold weather that we had a week or two ago. If so, the problem will clear up once the summer gets underway. Remove the affected leaves and provide enough sun and water for the plants. If it's not due to the weather, then it could be the beginning of Blight - this is a fungal disease, characterized by spots on lower leaves and stems that appear water-soaked. Avoid overhead watering, and remove diseased leaves.

Title: Holly is dying
User Question: Hi, we have 3 holly trees in our backyard near the pool, and one of them has started dying very quickly (over the past 2-3 weeks). I initially noticed the leaves turning yellow, and some googling said it could be due to overwatering and iron deficiency(?). So I checked and there was a leaking valve from our saltwater pool right next to the tree and the ground was saturated. I turned off the valve and the leak stopped, but the tree continued to get significantly worse. Last week I purchased some soil acidifier and iron supplement that I poured around the roots and additional iron supplement that I sprayed on the tree and the ground, but it seems to still be dying? I really don't want to lose this tree so any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
Expert Answer: Thanks for the submission. Unfortunately, salt damage is severe and most times (depending on tolerance) will kill a plant. Unfortunately, holly shrubs do not tolerate salt. The only way to remove salt from the root zone of the plant is to use gypsum and either water or rainwater. This will leach the salt away from the root zone of the holly. However, the next big issue will be overwatering due to the time of the year because not enough heat will not dry the soil out quickly enough.

Title: Tree Damage from Freeze
User Question: We have several cedar trees that seem to have browned seemingly overnight. They did well during the snow storm, but the freeze over the last couple of weeks really seems to have damaged them. I have read that freeze damage shows itself over a little time, but this has happened in a matter of days. What would be the best thing to try and save them (if possible)? I also noticed that almost all of these types in our neighborhood has similar damage, so it might be a good subject for an upcoming episode.
Expert Answer: Unfortunately this is a wait and see situation. This was an event that we haven't experienced for a very long time, if ever, and the full effects of the cold on plants won't be realized until the spring as plants break dormancy and begin growing again. Generally, needled evergreens like the cedar would not recover well when all the needles are killed, particularly true for pines, but there have been cases where cedars (those in the Cedrus genus) recover and send out new growth in the spring. One of the key factors will be if the buds that will provide the new growth for this year were damaged. Right now all we can do is wait. As the weather begins to warm and new growth (hopefully) appears this spring, keeping the plants properly watered and fertilized to encourage vigorous growth and avoid further stress will be important. Hopefully this helps.

I have found two or three in the house before a couple of years ago, again near the kitchen door and once near a sunroom which has a sliding door. All the times I found them in the fall, usually in the evening, but one during the day. Always this size too. I have not seen any adult roaches in or outside the house in the 7 years we've lived here. We find a lot of beetles and other strange bugs in the house often but not roaches. I'm pretty sure this is a roach even though I've never seen one this small. Thanks for your help.
