Invasive grass flower
Question Asker:
This small white flower invades the grass and multiplies and takes over the grass. It flowered in May but now in \
June stopped flowering. It roots are like a sweet potatoes and difficult to remove, you need to dig it up making \
your lawn look patchy.
Expert:
The weed you are trying to rid your lawn of is pennywort (Hydrocotyle americana, sometimes also known as \
dollarweed. It spreads by seed and by underground rhizomes and is a perennial that blooms early. It thrives in \
moist areas. The best way to control this broadleaf weed is to maintain a healthy lawn by regularly mowing at the \
recommended height for your variety of grass and watering deeply and infrequently to encourage deeper root \
growth. Monitor your lawn for areas that may need improved soil drainage. Fertilize your lawn appropriately; \
as recommended for your type of grass. Remove the weeds you presently have by hand pulling making sure to remove \
all roots. If your infestation is too broad to control by cultural methods, chemical control options are \
available. Use a herbicide designed to target this specific type of weed. Your local nursery operator can help \
you select the most effective application. When using any chemical read the label thoroughly and follow the \
instructions provided regarding the proper use and disposal Thank you for your question.

Is this horsenettle?
Question Asker:
I am thinking that the attached photo is of horsenettle. Is that correct? I would prefer not to use any \
chemicals, but are there other ways to remove it premanently? It has such a long tap root when I try to dif it \
up.
Expert:
It does look like Carolina Horsenettle (Solanum carolinense), though flowers (or if it stuck around long enough, \
fruits) would help to confirm the ID. It is native, but considered a weed in garden and agricultural settings. \ 
Either systemic herbicide to kill the roots or vigilant physical removal would be needed to eradicate it. If you \
wish to avoid herbicide, then dig up (or cut down) what you can, and remove any regrowth as quickly as it \
appears. Eventually, this will starve the roots of stored energy, and the plant(s) will stop regrowing. How long \
this process takes is hard to predict, but it might be several months at least if the plant(s) is well- \
established or mature. Even herbicide might take more than one application to be successful. Miri
