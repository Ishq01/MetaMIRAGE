        "question": "My Norfolk Island Pine is losing small branches. I have a large NI pine in my house. I got it 4 years ago, and it has done well. It is still growing, putting out new shoots at the top and new growth at the ends of the upper branches. However, in the last few months, quite a lot of the small needle bearing 'fronds' are browning and falling off. This is happening at the bottom and also in the innermost parts on the lower half of the plant. I imagine it needs repotting, so would that cause this to occur? I have been afraid to do this because I don't know how or when (Best time of year?) to do it. (asked at 2022-09-01 11:17:15, Guilford County, North Carolina)",
        "answer": "It is normal for Norfolk Island Pines (Araucaria heterophylla) to lose some needles or small branches, especially from the lower or innermost parts of the plant. Typically, this is simply part of the plant's natural aging process and is not a sign of a serious problem, particularly if new growth is still occurring at the top and branch tips. However, if you are noticing more widespread browning and shedding, several factors may be contributing:\n\n\u2022 **Humidity**: These plants thrive in high humidity\u2014ideally about 50%. Most indoor environments are much drier, especially in winter when heating is used, which can lead to browning and needle drop. Using a humidifier nearby or misting the plant can help, but a humidifier is most effective.\n\n\u2022 **Light**: Ensure your plant gets bright, indirect light. It does best with a few hours of direct sun each day but can adapt to bright, filtered light. Rotate the plant regularly (about a quarter turn weekly) so it grows evenly and doesn't lean toward the light source.\n\n\u2022 **Watering**: Overwatering is more damaging than underwatering for Norfolk Island Pine. Water only when the top inch of soil feels dry, and drain any excess water that collects in the saucer after about 15 minutes. Consistently soggy soil can cause root damage and needle drop.\n\n\u2022 **Fertilizing**: When the plant is actively growing, use a fertilizer formulated for houseplants. However, do not fertilize during its winter rest period.\n\n\u2022 **Temperature and Drafts**: Keep your plant in a spot with daytime temperatures of 60\u201370\u00b0F and somewhat cooler nights. Avoid hot or cold drafts, as these can also cause stress and increased needle loss.\n\n\u2022 **Repotting**: Although being somewhat root-bound does not usually harm this plant and will often not cause significant needle drop, if the roots are visibly circling the pot or the plant dries out quickly after watering, it may be time to repot. The best time to repot is in spring, just before the plant resumes active growth. Move it to a container that is just one size larger than the current pot and use fresh potting soil.\n\nIn summary: some needle and branch loss, especially on lower or inner branches, is expected. Focus on increasing humidity, maintain proper watering and lighting, and repot in spring only if needed. Monitor for continued healthy new growth, which is a good sign the plant is thriving.",

        "question": "How can we maximize growth in our stunted garden in Casper? This year, my spouse and I tried our hand at raised bed gardening. We are new to Wyoming and this was our first time going all in with the plants (the year before was just container gardening). We purchased quality soil and compost and planted starts and seeds after Memorial Day. Our plants are quite small for being in the bed 'growing' since late May, early June. We even tried replanting some items (arugula, beets, lettuce) and if anything did grow it remains stunted. (asked at 2022-09-07 00:37:51, Natrona County, Wyoming)",
        "answer": "There are some gardens around town that are just looking tremendous, and several are struggling. I believe it is due to the heat we've had. The weather went from cold and wet to hot and dry. It seems that not enough watering has kept the soil moist enough to support the plants. If you have a very barky organic growing medium, it may not be holding sufficient water. I recommend a mix of 5% organic matter to 95% soil (sand, silt, clay). You may need to add some native soil rather than just using the purchased growing medium. It's also advised to only allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings, and using shade cloth during the hottest part of the day would help. Most garden plants need 6 - 8 hours of sun, but may not require the excessive heat. The cool-season crops you mentioned are plants that can be put out in the garden while still getting snow, so in late February or early March, consider planting those to get a head start.",

        "question": "What kind of pest is doing this, and what should I do about it? I have noticed something curious happening in my lawn recently as it has begun growing again. I saw little sandy mounds but no insects. Are they perhaps ant hills? What exactly is causing this? What should I do about it? (asked at 2023-05-03 23:18:55, Multnomah County, Oregon)",
        "answer": "The small sandy mounds in your lawn, each with a central hole, are made by native ground nesting bees, commonly called mining bees or digger bees. These solitary bees burrow into the ground to lay their eggs, and each mound marks the entrance to an individual bee\u2019s nest. The holes are typically about 1/4 inch in diameter and may appear in clusters if soil and lawn conditions are suitable\u2014such as areas with thin grass and well-drained, exposed soil.\n\nMining bees are not aggressive and very seldom sting; most of the bees you see flying are males, which do not have stingers, and the females rarely sting. Their period of activity is short, generally lasting only 2 to 4 weeks per year.\n\nThese bees are harmless to your lawn\u2014they do not cause damage and actually help aerate the soil. They are beneficial pollinators important for the health of local plants. If you are not bothered by the appearance of the mounds, the best approach is to leave them alone, as the bees will naturally disappear after their active period.\n\nIf you would prefer to discourage them, you can make your lawn less appealing to ground nesting bees by watering regularly during their active weeks and working to improve the thickness and density of your grass, thereby eliminating bare or sparsely vegetated patches. Establishing dense turf or using groundcovers can also help reduce future nesting sites. Do not use insecticides; controlling these native pollinators is not recommended.\n\nIn summary, these bees are not harmful and are considered beneficial, so the recommended action is to simply ignore them and allow them to complete their short life cycle undisturbed.",

        "question": "Something is causing dimples on my newly developing Honeycrisp apples. About 10% of the fruits are affected as of today, 13 June, with anywhere from 1 to 4 dimples on each affected fruit. There appears to be some insect larva within the fruit. What insect or other pest is causing this and what can I do to prevent it from happening to more of the developing Honeycrisp apples? My understanding is that apple maggots normally appear later in the season, typically July. Has the warm winter of 2023-2024 caused an early emergence? Any advice or tips are much appreciated. Otherwise, the trees are healthy and in good condition. (asked at 2024-06-13 21:47:46, Nicollet County, Minnesota)",
        "answer": "Based on your description and the photos, the damage to your Honeycrisp apples\u2014dimples on the fruit, with evidence of insect larvae inside, affecting about 10% of apples in mid-June\u2014is most likely caused by the plum curculio (Conotrachelus nenuphar). This is supported by the characteristic markings: distinctive, often crescent-shaped tan impressions and misshapen fruit. Plum curculio adults become active in early spring and lay eggs in developing apples; the larvae develop inside, causing dimples and internal damage. The adult beetle is small, dark brown with a curved snout, and the larvae are yellow-white, C-shaped, and about 1/4 inch long (though they are rarely seen).\n\nThis differs from apple maggot (which is typically active from July to September and does not usually occur this early in the season) and from other causes of dimpling such as apple scab, apple curculio, or tarnished plant bug, based on the timing and internal larval evidence.\n\nManagement:\n- Remove any infested and dropped fruit from the ground, as this will reduce the local pest population and limit reinfestation.\n- Kaolin clay (a commercially available horticultural clay product) can be sprayed as a nonchemical barrier on fruit and foliage to interfere with egg-laying and deter adult beetles.\n- For future protection, monitor trees starting at bloom and treat early in the season, as adults are most active at this time.\n\nA warm winter can sometimes lead to earlier than average pest activity, so earlier signs of plum curculio are possible this year. Continue inspecting fruit through the rest of the season and take action as needed.\n\nYour trees otherwise being healthy is a positive sign and should aid their recovery. Dispose of affected fruit to prevent larvae from completing their development. If intervention is needed in coming years, consider kaolin clay or consult your local extension for information on effective organic or conventional insecticides as appropriate for your situation.",

        "question": "I have two patches of wood lilies in my yard. About three seasons ago, one of the patches of wood lilies yellowed and died right after the Fourth of July.

I'm now suspicious it's a weed. Over 5 feet tall now. About to flower or go to seed. Should I pull it? (asked at 2020-08-14 21:03:05, Multnomah County, Oregon)",
        "answer": "Based on your description and the provided images, your plant is likely hairy willow-herb (Epilobium hirsutum). This is a tall, semi-aquatic perennial that can grow up to 6 feet, with upright, branched stems and lance-shaped, toothed leaves that are mostly opposite on the stem. It thrives in wet soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, or damp meadows.\n\nHairy willow-herb is classified as a Class B Noxious Weed in Washington State. Its aggressive and dense growth can crowd out native or beneficial plants, and it has the ability to form large, monotypic stands in wetlands. It spreads both by wind-dispersed seeds and thick rhizomes (underground stems), with flowers blooming July through August. The plant is on the state quarantine list, making it illegal to transport, buy, sell, or distribute it or its parts in Washington.\n\nManagement Recommendations:\n- Remove the plant as soon as possible, ideally before it flowers or goes to seed.\n- Small infestations can be hand-dug\u2014be meticulous in removing all roots and rhizomes to prevent regrowth. Missed fragments can easily re-sprout.\n- Bag and dispose of all plant parts\u2014including roots and any flowers\u2014in the garbage, not compost. Do not transport the plant off-site unless it is contained and destined for landfill disposal.\n- For larger infestations, chemical control may be necessary, but only state-approved aquatic herbicides can be used in wet areas and permits may be required.\n- Keep monitoring the area for new growth each year, as ongoing control is often needed.\n\nPrompt removal and careful disposal are important to prevent this invasive weed from spreading further and impacting native habitats.",
