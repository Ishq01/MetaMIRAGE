Our grass also have some type of fungus through out, and unsure if this is related.\nexpert: Thank you for your question. I don\u2019t think that any possible fungus in your yard is associated with this formation on your hackberry. We have been getting a fair number of questions so far this season dealing lawn fungus. We believe that this may be due to heavy, recent rainfalls. The foliage on the tree is puzzling to me. By any chance do you still have the plant label that came attached to the tree? Lacking that, if you know where you purchased the tree, might you be able to contact them and see what kind of records they have regarding the lineage of the tree. Specifically ask if your hackberry is a hybrid plant.  Lastly, have you ever done any pruning of the tree? I am trying to decide if its current appearance came after some pruning events, or if it developed naturally. For how many years has it looked like this? Looking forward to your responses. Thanks for using our forum.\nuser: This was planted as a young tree by the builders in a new development 5 years ago and they told us it was a hackberry but that's all the information I have on it. No pruning of the tree. Last year it did have the raised warts on the backs of most leaves. I believe it started last year but very mild and I didn't think much of it. This year is worse than last. More noticeable.\u00a0On Mon, Jun 17, 2024, 6:15\u202fPM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nexpert: Thanks for your response. I suspect that the \u201cwarts\u201d you observed both last year and this year are attributable to mites known as hackberry Psyllids (Pachypsylla celtidismamma). They will not harm your hackberry and they can simply be ignored. More specifically these \u201cwarts\u201d are called leaf galls. They have mite larvae within them. The adults of these insects are extremely small and hard to detect. See the following for images of the galls and the adults: https://bugguide.net/node/view/229821 https://bugguide.net/node/view/229829 Here\u2019s the deal.\u00a0 In spring 2023, adults of these insects emerged from places where they had overwintered during 2022-23. This could have been under pieces of bark or some other nook or cranny of the hackberry. These adults mated and females laid eggs on the leaves of your tree. Larvae quickly hatched. These larvae burrowed into the leaf tissue. The leaves responded by enclosing the larvae with a form of a leaf cancerous growth that is a type of defensive response. This led to the appearance of the bumps and nodules (galls) that you saw in 2023. These larvae developed into adults in late summer 2023. The adults went into hibernation for the winter 2023-24. When they emerged early this 2024 season, the process started all over again. See: https://extension.illinois.edu/blogs/garden-scoop/2019-07-25-hackberry-gall https://lancaster.unl.edu/pest/resources/hackberrypsyllids.shtml Going back to the shape of the hackberry, how long have you been noticing this shape? Since it was planted? Both last year (2023) and this year (2024)? At this point, I am still formulating possible explanations. Thanks again for consulting with us.

If the bark continues to regenerate and the branch remains healthy, you may not need to prune it. To support the healing process, you can apply a tree wound dressing to protect the injury site from pests and diseases. Ensure the tree is well-watered and mulched to reduce stress and promote overall health.\n\nRegarding the rootstock and trunk, the diameter difference is a common occurrence in grafted trees and may not necessarily pose a problem unless the rootstock is unable to support the tree's needs. Monitor the tree for signs of stress, such as wilting or poor growth. If the rootstock is significantly smaller, it might struggle to supply adequate water and nutrients, in which case providing additional support, such as staking, might be beneficial.

This is especially important if you suspect fungal issues like anthracnose, as the spores can survive in leaf litter.\n\n2. **Fertilization**: Applying a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring can provide essential nutrients to support new growth. However, avoid over-fertilizing, as this can lead to excessive growth that may be more susceptible to pests and diseases.\n\n3. **Watering**: Ensure the tree receives adequate water, especially during dry spells. Deep watering encourages deep root growth, which can help the tree withstand stress.\n\n4. **Mulching**: Apply a layer of organic mulch around the base of the tree, but keep it away from the trunk. This helps retain soil moisture and regulate temperature.\n\n5. **Monitoring**: Continue to monitor the tree for any signs of pest infestations or disease. Early detection and treatment are key to managing these issues effectively.\n\nBy taking these proactive steps, you can help fortify your white oak against stressors and promote its overall health.",

Earwigs are attracted to dark, moist areas. 2)\u00a0use a small cup of oil (any type, any flavor)\u00a0and bury it so just the lip is sticking up over the edge of the soil - the earwigs will find the oil and drown. This is like a beer trap for slugs.  Insecticides are generally not needed. Consider using some mulch around your plants - like lawn clippings - this may help deter some insect damage and also promote soil moisture and less weeds.\nuser: I didn\u2019t find earwigs.

        "utterance": "Based on your description and the presence of grasshoppers, it's likely that they are the culprits causing damage to your plants. Grasshoppers can be quite destructive, especially in large numbers. Here are some steps you can take to manage them:\n\n1. **Organic Control**: \n   - **Neem Oil**: This is an organic pesticide that can deter grasshoppers. Spray it on the affected plants, following the instructions on the label.\n   - **Floating Row Covers**: Use these to physically block grasshoppers from reaching your plants.\n   - **Encourage Natural Predators**: Birds, frogs, and beneficial insects like praying mantises can help control grasshopper populations.\n\n2. **Non-Organic Control**: \n   - If the infestation is severe and you decide to use a chemical insecticide, look for products specifically labeled for grasshoppers. Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully to minimize any potential harm to beneficial insects and the environment.\n\n3. **Professional Help**: If you prefer, you can contact a local pest control service for an on-site evaluation and treatment plan. They can provide targeted solutions based on the specific conditions in your garden.\n\nRemember to monitor your plants regularly and take action as soon as you notice any new damage. This will help you manage the problem more effectively.",

        "utterance": "To effectively manage and eliminate hairy nightshade from your acreage, you can consider the following methods: \n\n1. **Mechanical Control**: Regularly mow or hand-pull the plants before they set seed. This is most effective when the plants are young and the soil is moist, making it easier to remove the entire root system.\n\n2. **Cultural Control**: Maintain a healthy, competitive ground cover to reduce the establishment of nightshade. This can include planting cover crops or maintaining a dense lawn.\n\n3. **Chemical Control**: If the infestation is severe, you may consider using herbicides. Products containing glyphosate or triclopyr can be effective, but it's important to follow the label instructions carefully and consider the impact on surrounding plants and wildlife.\n\n4. **Prevention**: Regularly monitor your property for new growth and remove it promptly to prevent further spread.\n\nAlways ensure that any control method you choose is safe for your pets and the environment. If you're unsure about using herbicides, consulting with a local extension office or a professional landscaper can provide more tailored advice.",

One possibility is that they are caused by a type of wood-boring insect, such as powderpost beetles, which can leave similar trails. However, since you haven't observed any insects, it's also possible that these marks are due to natural wood grain patterns or changes in the wood due to humidity and temperature fluctuations. Given the age of your house, the wood may have developed these patterns over time. To address this, you might consider consulting a pest control expert to rule out any insect activity. Additionally, maintaining stable humidity levels in your home can help prevent further changes in the wood.

        "utterance": "It's good that you've taken steps to address the aphid problem. Spraying with water can help dislodge some aphids, but using a fruit tree spray like Bonide is a more effective method for controlling them. As for the ants, they are often attracted to the honeydew produced by aphids. While ants themselves don't harm the tree, they can protect aphids from predators, which can exacerbate the aphid problem. To manage the ants, you might consider using a sticky barrier around the trunk of the tree to prevent them from climbing up. Additionally, managing the aphid population will naturally reduce the ant presence. For your peach trees, the same principles apply if you notice similar issues. Regular monitoring and early intervention are key to managing these pests effectively.",

        "utterance": "To manage the bindweed effectively and prepare for seeding, you can take the following steps: \n\n1. **Bindweed Control**: Bindweed is notoriously difficult to control, but consistent management can help. Since you've already applied weed/feed, consider using a targeted herbicide specifically for bindweed. Be sure to follow the label instructions carefully.\n\n2. **Timing for Seeding**: Since you plan to seed in mid-October, ensure that any herbicide used does not have a residual effect that could harm the new grass seedlings. Check the label for any waiting period before planting.\n\n3. **Covering the Area**: Covering the area with plastic again could help suppress the bindweed, but it might also delay your seeding plans. If you decide to cover it, you may need to adjust your seeding timeline.\n\n4. **Seeding Strategy**: If you choose to seed this fall, ensure the soil is well-prepared and free of debris. If bindweed is still a concern, you might consider seeding in the spring after another round of weed control.\n\n5. **Long-term Management**: For long-term control, consider a combination of cultural practices such as regular mowing, maintaining a healthy lawn to outcompete weeds, and possibly using pre-emergent herbicides in the spring.\n\nUltimately, the decision to seed now or wait until spring depends on the severity of the bindweed and your willingness to manage it over time. If the bindweed is extensive, waiting until spring might give you more time to control it effectively.",

My first two years gardening here were incredible.  2021 especially - I filled every cupboard shelf in my house with preserved food, and was still absolutely throwing it at neighbors.\r\n\r\nIn 2022 I purchased bulk compost from a nearby nursery and it was a disaster.  Absolutely nothing grew.  Plants would grow to about 2 inches high and simply stop growing at all.  After running a compost test with the university of Delaware, it was determined the compost was super under-cooked and very nitrogen deficient.  Something like 1/40 of what it should be.  Anyway 2022 was a total bust, but after a year of laying effectively fallow, I am struggling again in 2023.  \r\n\r\nI heavily tilled everything in with a tractor this year so the soil is thoroughly mixed.  I mulched the top to keep weeding under control.  There has also been some wild weather with bursts of 80-90 degree weather in April, and some dips into the 30s in May.  I have had to start several plants over that attempted to flower despite being only a few inches tall.  But my primary problem is plants seem to just languish and not grow at all.  Only my beans are suffering obvious pest damage.  Everything else appears to just turn slightly yellow or simply grow *incredibly* slowly.  A soil test this year from before I planted anything showed the soil was quite healthy, and over-nutrient rich in certain areas if anything.\r\n\r\nAttached are a few pictures.  The peas in question are almost 2 months old now, and simply do not seem to be getting any larger.  The peppers shown have not gotten any larger since I transplanted them outside 2 weeks ago.  The spinach plants pictured have not grown at all since transplanting maybe 4 weeks ago, and have begun to turn yellow.  Many of my plants are suffering similar fates.\r\n\r\nTomatoes seem to be struggling to grow, and have started to put flowers out despite being only 18 inches or so tall.  Lettuce growing very slowly.  Bokchoi looks like the spinach.  Broccoli plants languishing at 8 inches or so tall and have not grown in weeks.  Only my asparagus is absolutely thriving, and it's in a separate plot which did not receive any compost last year. \r\n\r\nI am thoroughly stumped.  No obvious pest damage except beans which I am treating separately. My first two years gardening here were so productive and the last 2 now have been so disappointing.  Aside from the compost added last year, I do not think I am doing anything differently.\r\n\r\nAny help or instruction is appreciated.  Let me know if there's any information or pictures that would help diagnose.  Happy to also perform more tests or anything needed.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n-Alex\nexpert: Hi- Please attach scans or PDFs of your soil test and compost\u00a0reports.\u00a0  The yellowing of the older, outer spinach leaves suggests nitrogen deficiency. Try fertilizing your plants with a complete (contains nitrogen,\u00a0phosphorous, and potassium)\u00a0soluble fertilize. Either a liquid or dry fertilizer that you mix with water and apply around the base of your plants.\u00a0  Pepper is slow-growing. Were your\u00a0pepper transplants healthy and green when planted? And then slowly yellowed? Did you fertilize your transplants and seedlings with a soluble fertilizer at planting?  There may be several causes for the problems you presented. Stressed transplants will flower prematurely and that could have been independent of soil issues.\u00a0  The immature compost may have\u00a0had a high carbon:nitrogen ratio. Soil microbes would have used the available nitrogen in the soil\u00a0to fully digest the compost.\u00a0If additional nitrogen was not added to the soil you would see slow growth and off-color foliage.\u00a0  The wood chip mulch may also be contributing to the problem\u00a0if the chips\u00a0are mixed into the soil. Wood chips are wonderful for walkways but are not\u00a0generally used around vegetable crops. Jon\nuser: Hey there, Thanks so much for the feedback.\u00a0 Soil test results from 2020 (when it was just lawn grass when we moved in), compost test results from august of 2022, and soil tests from my main vegetable plot and asparagus patch in 2023 are attached.\u00a0\u00a0The pepper plants were very green but roughly the same size when transplanted outdoors.\u00a0 I know we had a few colder nights this May but I'd been pretty careful about covering everything up if it ever looked like it was going to dip under 50.\u00a0 I did fertilize the ground under every transplant, and generally use a little extra potting soil when filling in around new plants.\u00a0 But yes, just as you described, the plants were healthy and green when moved outside, and slowly began to yellow and stagnate.\u00a0\u00a0It's just bizarre\u00a0because my garden was an absolute jungle in 2021.\u00a0 I could barely fit between my tomato plants, and some of them must have been at least 6 feet high.\u00a0 Completely out of control in every direction taking over the whole yard.Yes the wood chips are a new addition this year, but are not mixed into the soil.\u00a0 Just about an inch to 2 inch layer on top to help keep weeds in order.\u00a0 As this was all lawn-grass when we moved in keeping the grass under control has been challenging.\u00a0 In prior years I put down garden fabric over the entire area but inevitably small pieces of fabric or plastic would end up in the soil and I was hoping this would be a better solution.\u00a0 If you recommend against wood mulch, let me know!\u00a0 Are there any alternatives, or ought I go back to fabric?I will try applying a nitrogen heavy fertilizer to the plot.\u00a0 If the soil tests offer any additional insight, or if any other information would be helpful, just let me know.\u00a0 Thanks so much,-Alex TornabeneOn Mon, May 22, 2023 at 10:58\u202fAM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nexpert: Hi- The soil test reports look fine. The soil organic matter levels are very high. The compost test report results are strange. Very loow nutrient and salts level and the carbon % is half what is typical. The C:N ratio is almost double what it should be which explains, in part, why plants are growing slowly. Available nutrients are feeding soil microbes instead of plants.  If using liquid fertilizers be sure that it's reaching the plant roots and not just soaking into the wood chip mulch. You can also rake the mulch aside to incorporate a dry/granular fertilizer into the top few inches of soil and re-apply the mulch.  Many weeds will germinate and grow through a 1-2 inch wood chip mulch layer. Covering the soil with sections of newspaper covered with wood chips is one option. Organic growers use silage tarps or heavy-duty landscape fabric to kill vegetation and then remove the tarps or fabrics. Never cover landscape fabric with mulch. Perennial weeds will knit the soil and fabric into an immovable mess. Jon\nuser: Awesome, I appreciate\u00a0the feedback.

        "utterance": "Given the high organic matter levels and the nitrogen deficiency indicated by your compost test, I recommend using a balanced fertilizer with a higher nitrogen content to address the nitrogen deficiency. Look for a fertilizer with an N-P-K ratio where the first number (nitrogen) is higher, such as 10-5-5 or 20-10-10. This will help provide the necessary nitrogen to support plant growth.

Regarding your crabapple tree, if the damage is due to borers, addressing the infestation is crucial for the tree's survival. You might want to consider a diagnostic test to confirm the presence of borers. As for pruning, crabapple trees can generally tolerate substantial pruning, but it's best done in late winter or early spring before new growth starts. This timing helps to minimize stress on the tree and encourages healthy growth. If you prune in the fall, be cautious not to remove too much, as it can make the tree more vulnerable to winter damage.

        "utterance": "The symptoms you are describing on your Gravenstein apples are consistent with a condition known as 'cork spot' or 'bitter pit.' This is a physiological disorder often caused by a calcium deficiency in the fruit. It is not related to insect damage, which is why you don't see any stylet holes. To prevent this issue in the future, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Soil Testing and Amendment**: Conduct a soil test to check for calcium levels and amend the soil as necessary. Adding lime can help increase calcium availability.\n\n2. **Calcium Sprays**: Apply calcium sprays to the trees during the growing season. This can help improve calcium uptake by the fruit.\n\n3. **Water Management**: Ensure consistent watering, as fluctuations in soil moisture can exacerbate calcium uptake issues.\n\n4. **Pruning and Thinning**: Proper pruning and thinning of the fruit can help reduce the demand on the tree's resources, allowing for better nutrient distribution.\n\n5. **Fertilization**: Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can promote rapid growth that may outpace the tree's ability to supply calcium to the developing fruit.\n\nImplementing these practices should help reduce the occurrence of cork spot in your apples next year. If the problem persists, consulting with a local extension service or a professional arborist may provide additional insights tailored to your specific orchard conditions.",

It is important to apply Bt directly to the foliage of the plant where the worms are feeding, rather than to the soil. This will ensure that the worms ingest the bacteria when they consume the leaves. Additionally, to prevent future infestations, consider cleaning up fallen leaves and debris around the bush in the fall, as this can help reduce overwintering sites for the pests. You might also consider introducing beneficial insects, such as parasitic wasps, which can help control the worm population naturally. Regular monitoring of your bushes will also help you catch any future infestations early.",

The backyard was once a lawn, but it has been neglected for the past several years and is now completely full of weeds. Nearly 95% weeds, mostly false strawberry. I have spoken with friends and done extensive research online, and it sounds like this is one of those last resort cases where there really isn't much to do except start completely over. We are trying to go for sustainable options, such as reducing the amount of lawn at all by adding some hardscaping, but we do want some lawn. Most of the recommendations I have found say to use a broad spectrum herbicide, wipe out all the weeds, and then replant grass. Others recommend solarizing the yard by covering it with thick clear plastic for several weeks to kill all the weeds and then replant. I don't want to kill everything that lives in the soil, especially the bumblebees (of which we have several, though the grubs I could do without) but I also want to do my part for the environment and avoid herbicides if possible. Are there any other options I should consider? Is this really one of those cases where we are truly down to the last resort?\r\n\r\n*Image note: the two dirt piles once were pallet-enclosed garden beds that were rotting apart and are being removed.\n",
        "decision": "<Respond>",
        "utterance": "Given your situation and preferences, there are a few sustainable options you can consider to reclaim your backyard. Since you want to avoid herbicides and preserve beneficial soil life, you might want to try sheet mulching, also known as lasagna gardening. This method involves layering cardboard or newspaper over the weeds, followed by a thick layer of organic mulch such as straw, wood chips, or compost. This will smother the weeds and improve the soil as it breaks down. You can then plant grass seed or lay sod in the areas where you want a lawn. \n\nAnother option is to use a combination of manual removal and overseeding. You can manually remove the false strawberry and other weeds, then overseed with a grass variety suitable for your region. Consider using native grass species that are more adapted to your local climate and require less maintenance. \n\nAdditionally, incorporating hardscaping elements like gravel paths, stone patios, or raised beds can reduce the lawn area and provide structure to your backyard. These elements can also help with drainage and reduce the need for extensive lawn care. \n\nLastly, consider consulting with a local landscape professional who specializes in sustainable practices to get personalized advice and assistance. They can help you design a backyard that meets your needs while being environmentally friendly.",

I have lived here since 2004 and for the first time ever I am having delayed leafing from my maple tree which is located on the lake side of my house. It does not appear to have a fungus. All the leaves are a beautiful green without any marks on them.....they're just WAY smaller than every other tree around. I personally apply fertilizer throughout the year and I have an irrigation system as well.....so I have a hard time believing there's an issue with that.  I'm wondering if that deck is the issue HOWEVER there has always been a deck there (again, we have lived here since 2004) but we DID have it completely redone 3 years ago. That seating area around the trunk was created at the time and the deck also goes out to the left about 4-5 feet further than the original deck did.  It does not physically touch the trunk.....we keep the deck cut back to ensure this.....but it is very close to it.  I am in desperate need of someone to come out and make recommendations including deep root fertilization if needed.  I cannot lose this tree.  FYI my wife and I are both MSU alums.\nexpert: Sometimes trees will produce smaller leaves because of issues that aren't easily apparent. They can be related to vascular diseases that restrict water and nutrients from reaching the leaves, damage to roots, over or under fertilization, girdling roots,\u00a0or pest feeding in a hidden location. Girdling roots are especially common in maples planted in the landscape. This can cause issues over the years as the plant grows.\u00a0Most established trees don't require fertilizer so we recommend getting a soil test before applying any as excessive fertilization can actually lead to other nutrient deficiencies.\u00a0  I've included a link to find a certified arborist in your area. You will want them to come out and inspect the base of the tree, under the porch, for any damage. They may be able to remove the top layer of soil to see if there are any issues with roots that are near the surface or if there are issues with compaction or drainage. https://www.treesaregood.org/\nuser: Any chance it's from Armillaria root rot?

        "utterance": "Herbicide drift can indeed cause damage to trees, and the symptoms you're seeing, such as curled leaves, align with this. The good news is that trees can often recover from such damage, especially if the exposure was a one-time event. The affected leaves will not recover, but the tree can produce new growth next year. To help the tree recover, ensure it is well-watered, especially during dry spells, and avoid any additional stressors like fertilization or pruning until it shows signs of recovery. If the herbicide exposure was significant, there might be some residual effects, but generally, trees can grow out of it. Monitoring the tree next spring will be important to assess its recovery. If you notice similar symptoms next year, it might be worth investigating further or consulting with a local arborist.",

We replaced lots of grass with mainly low water perennials from the Garden-In-A-Box. The grass under the oak was removed and replaced with weed barrier and mulch. We also added some large rocks. Instead of watering grass we cut back on the water around the oak, and some other trees. The first symptoms began last summer (2023) with some leaf die-off, especially around the top. We had a tree company remove the \u201ddead\u201d (I assumed they were dead) branches. The die off has continued into this year. Unfortunately the landscapers did not think to tell us that these changes might damage even a relatively mature tree. \u2639And of course, I never thought to ask. In short there\u2019s been substantial change around the tree.

        "utterance": "Hi, Elliot, thank you for providing the detailed information and photos. Based on the changes you've described, it seems the tree is likely stressed due to the significant alterations in its environment, particularly the reduction in water and the removal of grass which previously helped retain moisture. Here are some steps you can take to help rehabilitate your English Oak:\n\n1. **Watering:** Increase the frequency of deep watering, especially during dry periods. Ensure the soil around the drip line is moist but not waterlogged. Consider using a soaker hose or drip irrigation to provide consistent moisture.\n\n2. **Mulching:** Ensure the mulch is not piled against the trunk, as this can cause rot. A layer of mulch can help retain soil moisture and regulate temperature.\n\n3. **Soil Aeration:** If the soil is compacted, consider aerating it to improve water infiltration and root growth.\n\n4. **Monitor for Pests and Diseases:** Although you haven't observed any insects, continue to monitor the tree for any signs of pests or diseases, as stressed trees are more susceptible.\n\n5. **Consult an Arborist:** Given the extent of the changes and the tree's current condition, consulting a certified arborist for an on-site evaluation might be beneficial. They can provide specific recommendations and assess any structural concerns.\n\nImplementing these steps should help improve the tree's health over time. Please keep us updated on any changes or improvements you observe. Best of luck with your oak tree!",

Herbicide drift can cause damage to non-target plants, and symptoms can include leaf curling, discoloration, and stunted growth. As for recovery, trees can sometimes grow out of herbicide damage, but it depends on the extent of the exposure and the overall health of the tree. Ensure the tree is well-watered and avoid additional stressors. Monitor the tree next spring for new growth. If the damage was not too severe, the tree may recover over time.

Could you send a picture of the lower trunk, where it meets the soil line? I do see the insects, possibly leafhoppers or aphids, and the white spots likely associated with their feeding. However,\u00a0I don't believe that the leaf/branch dieback is actually due to the insects.\u00a0 Thanks! Hania\nuser: Hello, Riley,I noticed the die back starting about a month ago.Due to all the rain I have just started watering on Sunday.\u00a0Thank you,DebSent from my iPhone On Jun 27, 2023, at 10:18 AM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\ufeff\n",

        "utterance": "Based on the information provided and the images, it seems that the maple trees are experiencing stress, possibly due to a combination of factors. The white bugs you mentioned are likely aphids or another type of sap-sucking insect, which can cause white spots on leaves but are not typically responsible for significant dieback. The dieback of the lower branches could be due to several factors, including overwatering, poor drainage, or root issues exacerbated by the fabric and rocks in the landscaping, which can restrict root growth and water penetration.\n\nHere are some steps you can take:\n1. **Inspect the Soil and Drainage:** Check if the soil around the tree is compacted or if water is pooling, which could indicate poor drainage. Consider aerating the soil or adjusting the landscape fabric to improve water penetration.\n2. **Adjust Watering Practices:** Given the recent rain and your watering schedule, the tree might be receiving too much water. Monitor the soil moisture and adjust watering accordingly, ensuring the soil is moist but not waterlogged.\n3. **Manage Insects:** If the white bugs are aphids, you can manage them by spraying the leaves with a strong jet of water to dislodge them or using insecticidal soap if the infestation is severe.\n4. **Prune Affected Branches:** Remove any dead or severely affected branches to prevent the spread of potential diseases and to encourage new growth.\n5. **Monitor and Maintain:** Keep an eye on the tree's health and consider consulting a local arborist if the condition does not improve or if you notice additional symptoms.\n\nThese steps should help improve the health of your maple trees. If the problem persists, further investigation into potential diseases or environmental factors may be necessary.",

Here is a general resource on the insect from UMD Extension- https://extension.umd.edu/resource/white-prunicola-scale/ Here is another resource from UNH Extension on scale and this lists IPM (integrated pest management) strategies that will be useful no matter what type of scale it is- https://extension.unh.edu/resource/scale-insects-fact-sheet  I hope this is helpful and please get in touch with any other questions!\nuser: Thanks for the fast response Sean!

The white substance at the base of the needles could be a sign of fungal spores. It's a good practice to remove and dispose of the fallen needles, as they can harbor fungal spores that may reinfect the tree. Instead of using the fallen needles as mulch, consider using a different type of mulch that doesn't come from the affected tree. Additionally, ensure your tree has good air circulation and avoid overhead watering to help prevent further fungal issues. If the problem persists, you might want to consult with a local arborist or extension service for a more precise diagnosis and treatment plan.",

You might want to conduct a soil test to check this.\n\n2. **Watering**: Make sure the tree is getting adequate water, especially during dry spells, but avoid overwatering as Dogwoods do not like 'wet feet'.\n\n3. **Sunlight**: Dogwoods typically prefer partial shade. If your tree is in full sun, it might be under stress, which could affect blooming and leafing.\n\n4. **Pests and Diseases**: Check for signs of pests or diseases, which can also impact the health of the tree.\n\n5. **Pruning**: Proper pruning can help improve air circulation and light penetration, which can promote better blooming.\n\nSince your tree has leafed out beautifully this year, it might just be a late bloomer as you mentioned. Continue monitoring its progress and consider these factors to help it thrive. If the problem persists, consulting with a local arborist might provide more tailored advice.",

Since you've ruled out pests and soil disturbance, and given the symptoms of wilting from the top down, it could be a root-related issue such as root rot or a fungal infection. These can occur even if the surface soil appears undisturbed. If you're considering digging up the plant, inspect the roots for any signs of rot or discoloration. Healthy roots should be firm and white, while diseased roots may be mushy or dark. If you find root rot, you might be able to save the plant by trimming away the affected roots and replanting it in fresh, well-draining soil. Additionally, ensure that the plant is not being overwatered, as this can exacerbate root issues. Let me know if you find anything unusual with the roots, and we can explore further options.",

Lilacs can adapt to more sun, but it may take some time for them to adjust. The new growth and buds are positive signs that the plant is trying to adapt. To help your lilac bush, ensure it is well-watered, especially during dry spells, as the increased sun can lead to quicker soil drying. Mulching around the base can help retain moisture. As for pruning, the best time to trim a lilac bush is right after it finishes blooming in the spring. This is because lilacs set their buds for the next year shortly after blooming, so pruning later in the season can remove next year's flowers. Since you are seeing new growth, it might be best to wait until after the next bloom cycle to do any significant pruning. Keep an eye on the plant's health, and if the browning persists or worsens, consider checking for pests or diseases that might be affecting it.",

This pest is known to cause the kind of bark symptoms you're seeing, including the small black bumps and the darkened appearance. The lack of leaves on some branches and the cracks in the trunk are also consistent with the stress that this pest can cause to trees.\n\nTo manage Gloomy Scale, you can consider the following steps:\n1. **Pruning**: Remove and destroy any heavily infested branches to reduce the scale population.\n2. **Horticultural Oil**: Apply horticultural oil during the dormant season to smother the scales. This is most effective when applied in late winter or early spring before the leaves emerge.\n3. **Insecticidal Soap**: During the growing season, insecticidal soap can be used to target the crawlers, which are the mobile stage of the scale.\n4. **Professional Treatment**: If the infestation is severe, you may need to consult with a certified arborist or pest control professional who can apply systemic insecticides.\n\nIt's important to monitor the trees regularly and maintain their overall health through proper watering and fertilization to help them recover from the stress caused by the infestation.

        "utterance": "Transplanting strawberries can indeed be challenging in early spring, especially in colder climates. However, you can consider late summer or early fall as an alternative time for transplanting. This allows the plants to establish roots before the winter sets in, and the soil is usually warmer than in early spring. Make sure to water the plants well after transplanting to help them settle in. \n\nFor configuration, rows are a common method because they allow for easier access and maintenance. You could also consider a raised bed system, which can improve drainage and make it easier to manage the plants. Given your limited sunny areas, ensure that the new location receives at least 6-8 hours of sunlight per day for optimal growth. \n\nRegarding the squirrel issue, continue using your chicken wire cover, but consider reinforcing it or using a finer mesh to prevent smaller animals from getting through. You might also explore using bird netting as an additional layer of protection. \n\nIf you decide to use the spot in the back, ensure it meets the sunlight requirements and consider soil quality and drainage as well. Good luck with your strawberry patch transformation!",

        "utterance": "To replace the weeds with eco grass, using a method like sheet mulching with cardboard or burlap is a great idea. Since you're concerned about the cardboard being exposed, using burlap might be a better option as it allows for planting in the future and is less likely to become an eyesore. Covering the burlap with a thick layer of mulch will help suppress the weeds and improve the soil over time.\n\nFor mulch, wood chips are a good choice, especially since you are on the waitlist for them. They are cost-effective and break down slowly, providing long-term benefits. If you can find another source for wood chips, that might expedite your project. Once you have the wood chips, you can place them at the end of the driveway to avoid smothering your garden beds.\n\nRegarding watering, it's generally a good idea to water the wood chips after they are placed to help them settle and start the decomposition process. Watering once a week should be sufficient, depending on your local climate and rainfall. As for the time it takes for wood chips to be ready for seeding, it can vary, but generally, you might need to wait a few months for them to break down enough to plant eco grass seeds. You can speed up the process by adding a layer of compost beneath the wood chips.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",

Do I overwinter them above ground or sink them into the ground?\nexpert: Good Morning Rebecca, Thanks for reaching out!\u00a0I actually did the exact same thing with my lilac bush last spring! Also, thank you for sending those pictures. They were super helpful! When you dig up lilac shoots, you're only bring a small amount of the root mass with you, the bulk of the root system remains with the parent plant. This means that your new plants are getting far less water (and,, to a lesser extent, nutrient uptake) than they're used to. This means that the lilac shoots can be losing more water through transpiration in their leaves than they're able to pull up out of the soil. The result of this imbalance is leaf die-back. Some people will strip off all of the leaves except for the growing pair at the tip. Another option is to tie a clear plastic bag around the tree to keep the humidity level higher. For cuttings that I'm trying to root, I do both of these things, but for my lilacs, I just shoved them in the ground and let them fend for themselves. Although this article is about propagation by cuttings, many of the same rules apply:\u00a0https://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/ornamental/a-reference-guide-to-plant-care-handling-and-merchandising/propagating-foliage-flowering-plants/As for pots versus the ground, there's no hard-and-fast rule, but generally speaking, it's easier to transplant next year from a pot with less transplant shock (since you won't have to dig them up again), but you'll get healthier, more robust growth this year if they're in the ground since they'll have access to far more growing space and soil life. Personally, I leave my cuttings in pots until I'm certain they have significant root growth (anywhere from a month to a year), then I pop them into the ground either in their final home or what's known as a \"nursery bed.\" This is simply what has worked best for me in the past, though nothing is 100%.

        "utterance": "Hi, Morgan, it's great to hear you're taking proactive steps with your lilac shoots! For the leaf die-back, you can choose to remove some of the leaves to reduce transpiration stress, especially if the leaves are already significantly damaged. Applying a clear plastic cover can help maintain humidity around the plant, which might be beneficial if the environment is particularly dry. As for watering, ensure the soil is consistently moist but not waterlogged. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so it's important to find a balance. If the leaves are blanching due to insufficient water uptake, increasing the frequency of watering slightly might help, but always check the soil moisture first. Moving them to a shaded area, as you mentioned, is also a good step to reduce stress. I hope this helps, and feel free to reach out if you have more questions!",

In the past my broccoli grew thin and tall with small heads that I was able to harvest. This year I planted a different seed expecting a normal head close to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe actual plant is in the photo listed. The plant is 3.5 ft tall with a 2.5 in diameter stalk with no head in sight. What's the scoop?\nexpert: Hi, Elliot, thanks for the question.\u00a0\u00a0 The plant looks very healthy.\u00a0There are several things that can cause your broccoli to not head.\u00a0 Temperature can be a problem; however, I suspect that you may be looking at one of two things.\u00a0 First, if too much nitrogen is added to the soil you may not get the flower head since the plant is happy it doesn't have to reproduce. Another reason is the time to maturity.\u00a0 This can be somewhere between 55 to 70 days (give or take based on growing conditions). Do you know what the variety is. I look forward to your response.\nuser: Yes, I planted the seed in Mid April inside of my house Until mid May. After that, I transplanted it to the garden. I also have a second plant that is very much the same. I would guess that I am entering near 60 days in the garden. In addition, I planted cabbage and lettuce heads that I have harvested. They have been exceptional ( 3 of each). During the spring, I buried walleye remains between every plant\u00a0in my garden to include, sweet hungarian ( 4), bell peppers ( 4), cucumbers (4) and 7 different tomato plants all seem to be growing well.\u00a0 On Wed, Jul 12, 2023 at 11:38\u202fAM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\n",

It took so long to find one-we are unfortunately now well into hot weather.\r\nWhat is the best way to proceed?  How big a root ball should we create - that I can lift (!).  How big should the new tree pit be and how should it be prepared? How best to manage this move even tho it is occurring in the growing season - as opposed to fall?  The person who is receiving the tree is not an expert and I would like to help her.   What advice should I give her to help the tree survive.?  We are digging it up thi Saturday - the day after tomorrow! Help.\nexpert: Wow, the lucky recipient should be very happy!  Now is not a bad time to try and transplant, and spring is definitely better than fall for broadleaved evergreens, including Magnolias\u00a0which need to go into the winter as well-hydrated as possible. It gives it the whole growing season to try and establish more roots.  It is difficult to judge the size of your Magnolia volunteer. If the diameter of the trunk is larger than 2-3 inches you might consider\u00a0having a professional help you or root-pruning and waiting to transplant in the future. If you plan to go ahead, water both the tree and the new planting area well today. Before you dig the tree, make sure that the re-planting hole is already dug at the new location- your goal is to keep it out of the ground for the least amount of time. You will want to take as large a root ball as you (and maybe some helpers) can manage- they can get very heavy very quickly).\u00a0 You could try and manuever it onto a heavy tarp and drag it to your vehicle (trying not to handle it by the trunk) and get it as close to the new hole as possible before unloading. Here is our page on Planting Trees with lots of helpful information:\u00a0 https://extension.umd.edu/resource/planting-tree-or-shrub/  Water the planted tree well and give it a 2-3 inch (no more than 4) layer of mulch, but keep it pulled back from the trunk. Monitoring the tree for water needs is important for the entire first 18-24 months that a new tree is in the ground.

Are you able to resend larger photo files? (Ideally at least 1MB each, which will allow us to zoom-in.) If not, can you take closer photos of the mum and lavender symptoms? If you need to send more than three pictures, you can reply more than once, attaching different files each time, to get around the system limit of 3 attachments.  More information about their growing conditions may also help. Are they being monitored for watering needs now that regular rains have ended? Have they been growing in that location for a few years, or are they new additions? Direct sun from 9am to 1pm isn't quite enough to satisfy the needs of either of those plants, as they prefer full sun (6-8 or more hours of direct light in summer), but if they've flowered for you there in past years (and we see the lavender is blooming now), than it might suffice, though it will impact the plant's vigor and might make them more vulnerable to disease. (Sun helps to dry off foliage after dew or rain, and the longer the leaf surfaces remain damp, the more easily they can be infected by pathogen spores. A sunny location will keep the leaves drier than a semi-shade location.)  Miri\nuser: The Chrysanthemum leaves all across the yard have had the same blight as in the photo. The lavender usually survives well on the berm that is slanted toward the sun with 5 hours of sunlight. There are mature Oak and Cherry trees that shade over the lavender after 2 pm.

        "utterance": "Based on the symptoms you've described and the environmental conditions, it seems like the lavender and chrysanthemums might be experiencing different issues. The dots and scale-like mess on the lavender could be due to insect activity, such as the 4-lined Plant Bug, which you've mentioned. The dark grey blooms might be a result of environmental stress, possibly exacerbated by the drought and insufficient sunlight. For the chrysanthemums, the widespread blight suggests a fungal issue, which can be common in humid conditions or where air circulation is poor. \n\nTo manage these issues, consider the following steps:\n1. For the lavender, monitor for insect activity and consider using insecticidal soap or neem oil if pests are confirmed. Ensure the plants are watered adequately during the drought, but avoid overhead watering to reduce leaf wetness.\n2. For the chrysanthemums, remove and dispose of any heavily infected leaves to reduce the spread of the blight. Improve air circulation around the plants by spacing them appropriately and consider applying a fungicide if the problem persists.\n3. For both plants, consider increasing sunlight exposure if possible, as this can help reduce disease pressure by keeping foliage drier.\n\nIt's possible that the blight on the chrysanthemums could reappear next year, especially if the environmental conditions remain the same.

        "utterance": "Given the situation where the Rose of Sharon is sagging and breaking at the base, you have a few options. If the structural damage is severe and the tree is at risk of further splitting, it might be best to prune the damaged branches to reduce weight and prevent further damage. You can try to save the healthiest branches by selectively pruning the weaker ones, which might help the tree recover and maintain some of its structure. However, if the damage is too extensive and the tree's stability is compromised, it may be necessary to remove the tree entirely and consider replanting. If you choose to replant, you might want to consider a tree or shrub that is more resilient to heavy snow and rain conditions. Consulting with a local arborist could provide more tailored advice based on the specific condition of your tree and the images you've provided.",

Because so little sprouted, the lawn service returned on April 27 to \"remediate\": which involved spreading a thin layer of soil and re-seeding.  The fescue slowly sprouted, as I followed the watering instructions, but weeds grew faster.  I tried to weed, but got a late start for medical reasons, and was able to a first clearing of perhaps 2/3.  The rest is completely covered with weeds, and difficult at this point to remove by hand.

        "utterance": "The red spots on your rhubarb leaves are likely caused by a fungal disease known as Ascochyta leaf spot or Ramularia leaf spot. These fungi can cause red or brown spots on the leaves, but they do not affect the stalks, which can still be safely harvested if they are free of spots. To manage the disease, it is important to remove and destroy affected leaves to reduce the spread of spores. After the first freeze, cleaning up all plant debris and replacing mulch can help minimize overwintering spores. For organic treatment, you can use a copper-based fungicide, which is generally safe for use in organic gardening. Ensure good air circulation around the plants and avoid overhead watering to reduce humidity, which can exacerbate fungal growth. Regularly monitoring your plants and maintaining good garden hygiene will help manage the disease in the future.",

We\u2019d like to turn this area into grass and then eventually build some raised boxes for growing vegetables. I\u2019m nervous that if we just start pulling weeds that they will come back. The big leafy weeds have very strong roots and are hard to pull without breaking at the base.\n",
        "decision": "<Respond>",
        "utterance": "To effectively transform the overgrown area into a grass lawn, it's important to address the weed problem thoroughly. Here are some steps you can follow:\n\n1. **Remove Weeds:** Since the weeds have strong roots, it's crucial to remove them completely to prevent regrowth. You can do this by digging out the roots manually or using a weed removal tool. If the roots are particularly stubborn, consider using a systemic herbicide that targets the roots.\n\n2. **Tilling:** Once the weeds are removed, tilling the soil can help break up any remaining root fragments and prepare the soil for grass seed. Tilling also aerates the soil, which is beneficial for grass growth.\n\n3. **Soil Preparation:** After tilling, level the soil and add any necessary amendments, such as compost or topsoil, to improve soil quality.\n\n4. **Seeding:** Choose a grass seed suitable for your climate and sunlight conditions. Spread the seed evenly over the prepared area and lightly rake it into the soil.\n\n5. **Watering:** Keep the soil consistently moist until the grass is established. This usually means watering lightly but frequently.\n\n6. **Building Raised Beds:** Once the grass is established, you can plan and build your raised vegetable beds. Ensure they are placed in a location that receives adequate sunlight for vegetable growth.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively transform the area into a healthy grass lawn and prepare for future vegetable gardening.",

You might want to gently aerate the soil around the plant to improve drainage. Additionally, check the roots for any signs of rot or damage.

Over time, plants can become too dense, leading to poor air circulation and increased competition for nutrients and water, even if the watering schedule seems adequate. This can also make the plants more susceptible to fungal diseases, which might explain the black appearance when they die back. I recommend thinning out the plants to improve air circulation and reduce competition. Additionally, ensure that the soil is well-draining and consider applying a balanced fertilizer to support plant health. Keep an eye on the plants for any signs of fungal infection, and if necessary, treat with an appropriate fungicide.

Since you've already tried a fungicide without success, there are a few additional steps you can take:\n\n1. **Improve Air Circulation and Sunlight**: Ensure that the lawn is not overly shaded and that air can circulate freely. This can help reduce the humidity that fungi thrive in.\n\n2. **Adjust Watering Practices**: Water deeply but less frequently to encourage deep root growth. Water early in the morning to allow the grass to dry out during the day.\n\n3. **Mowing Practices**: Continue to mow regularly, but avoid cutting the grass too short. This can stress the grass and make it more susceptible to disease.\n\n4. **Soil Testing**: Consider having a soil test done to check for nutrient imbalances or pH issues that could be contributing to the problem.\n\n5. **Consult a Local Expert**: Since you're open to hiring someone, a local lawn care professional or extension service might be able to provide a more tailored solution after inspecting your lawn in person.\n\nSending a sample to a plant disease clinic is also a good step to get a definitive diagnosis.

        "decision": "<Respond>",
        "utterance": "To address the issue of low pH levels under Ponderosa pines, it's important to first confirm the soil pH. You can do this by collecting a soil sample from the problem area. Use a clean trowel to dig a small hole about 6 inches deep, and take a sample from the side of the hole. Mix samples from several spots in the problem area for a more accurate reading. You can use a home pH test kit or send the sample to a local extension service for analysis.\n\nOnce you have the pH level, you can adjust it if necessary. If the pH is too low (acidic), applying lime can help raise it to a more neutral level, which is more conducive to grass growth. As for fertilizer, a balanced fertilizer with a higher phosphorus content can help promote root growth, especially in areas that need reseeding. Look for a fertilizer with an N-P-K ratio like 10-20-10.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that the area receives adequate sunlight and water, as these are crucial for grass growth. Since the problem areas change each year, it might also be beneficial to aerate the soil to improve drainage and root penetration. Keep monitoring the pH and adjust your soil management practices as needed. Good luck, and feel free to reach out if you have more questions!",

The fact that these are in multiple species of trees and of different ages suggests that it's animal or weather-related. If these are all on the same side of the branch it could also be hail-related if you had hail in your area (for example every damaged area on the west facing branch across all species).\nuser: Hello, thank you for the response. Deer damage is possible. They have walked through in the past.\u00a0Some of the damage is on the underside of horizontal \u00a0branches but there is also\u00a0some on the main stem.\u00a0I was concerned it might be some type of canker, but hopefully just physical damage.

        "utterance": "Based on the information and images provided, it seems likely that the damage is due to physical causes such as deer rubbing or possibly hail, rather than a disease like canker. Since the damage is on multiple species and in various locations, it supports the idea of physical damage. For now, it's best to monitor the trees for any signs of disease progression, such as oozing or further discoloration. Avoid removing or shaving the damaged areas, as this can cause more harm than good. Instead, ensure the trees are well-watered and healthy to promote natural healing. If you notice any signs of disease, such as canker, in the future, it may be necessary to consult with a local arborist or extension service for specific treatment options.",

After doing some research online I believe my yard has a fungus known as melting out/leaf spot. I would be grateful if CSU could confirm or help identify the issue, I am experiencing. Attached are pictures before fungicide application and after in addition to a soil test from March 2024. I have additional photos if needed, page wont let me upload more than three. I provided notes below that maybe useful. Turf Type 766 sq feet blend of Kentucky Blue, Rye and Fescue. - I also have some tall fescue patches  . Lawn History Purchased home in May of 2022. Grass was in terrible condition. With some general care, frequent cutting, fertilizer and watering routine the grass was in much better condition by September 2022. Spring of 2023 the grass was thriving but by mid-June I began to see a lime green color throughout the lawn. I believed the lime green color to be an iron deficiency so I began introducing iron with my fertilizer applications. The iron helped but only for a short period of time and the color issue still exists to this day in the backyard as well. Possible Mistake Mid-March 2024 my grass remained dormant. Little to no signs of life. By mid-April I grew concerned with very little progress coming out of dormancy. The grass looked extremely dehydrated and appeared dormant. With little moisture in March and April I began to water my lawn thinking the lack of moisture was the problem. By mid-May my lawn was greening up but appeared to still have areas that were dormant. June 1st was when I started to take a deep look since the thought of the grass coming out of dormancy was out of question this late into the season. It was then I noticed yellow blades, spotting, along with dead blades mixed in. Looking back, I believe I made a huge error watering a good amount that early in the season with cooler temperatures. What I have done as of 6/23 Reduced watering to from 5 days a week to 3 days a week. June 5th - Dethatched  June 10th- Applied .58oz of Azoxystrobin and 1.58oz of Propiconazole 183411 Azoxy 2SC TO 1G Specimen.indd (cdms.net) Prime Source Propiconazole 14.3 Select Fungicide \u2013 Agroterra (agroterrausa.com) Fertilizer History In 2022 and 2023 I was on Scotts fertilizer program(granular). By mid-June 2023 I began incorporating iron as I mentioned in the history. Not satisfied with my lawn in 2023 I began looking into how I could make improvements in 2024. In early march of 2024, I did a soil test. Based on its results I made the decision to switch from granular fertilizers to a liquid spoon-feeding program (backpack sprayer) so I could be more precise increasing specific nutrients,. May 12, 2024 was my first fertilizer application. I used a product called GrowORR 17-0-17 by lawn supply company in addition to a micro nutrient supplement. I followed the associated rates for my sq ft.\n",

        "utterance": "Based on the information provided and the images attached, it seems like your lawn is indeed experiencing a fungal issue, likely melting out/leaf spot or grey leaf spot. Both of these fungal diseases can present similar symptoms, such as yellowing and spotting of the grass blades. The fungicides you have applied, Azoxystrobin and Propiconazole, are effective treatments for these types of fungal infections, so continuing with your current treatment plan is advisable. \n\nAdditionally, your plan to reseed in August/September is a good strategy, as cooler temperatures will help the new grass establish without the stress of summer heat. Make sure to choose a seed mix that is resistant to the common diseases in your area. \n\nTo prevent future issues, continue monitoring your watering practices, especially in early spring, to avoid overwatering when the grass is still dormant. Regular soil testing and adjusting your fertilization program based on the results will also help maintain a healthy lawn. If you continue to experience issues, consider consulting with a local extension office or a lawn care professional for further assistance.",

        "dialog_context": "user: We have had beautiful geraniums on our back deck for over 30 years. But the last two summers have been a disaster! For the first time last summer we bought our geraniums from Walmart and they soon withered and died. So this year we bought them from an expensive florist and put new dirt in the pots. They all started withering in a few days. We are desperate to have our beloved geraniums back. We would appreciate any suggestions you might have  for what is happening and how to fix the problem.\r\nThank you so much\nexpert: One die-off event might have been related to original plant quality (perhaps roots were stressed or dying from being over- or under-watered prior to purchase) but a second failure suggests something else is going on. You mention using new potting soil...was this just to replace some of the prior soil or all of it?\u00a0(Sometimes pathogens can remain in soil that is re-used for years, plus the soil breaks down over time and becomes more moisture-retentive and more poorly-drained, which is a condition zonal geraniums do not tolerate well.)  Are the containers drained well, with their drain holes remaining unobstructed? Are the containers being checked for watering needs before being watered so the plants aren't staying too wet?\u00a0We realize that with decades of successful geranium cultivation you likely are well aware of their needs, but we ask to try to narrow-down a potential diagnosis. The coloration of the foliage suggests\u00a0stress, and root stress in particular as\u00a0related to soil moisture\u00a0is one of the most common sources of decline if a pest or disease is not responsible. There is a lesion on the close-up leaf photo (possibly Botrytis)\u00a0but not of a disease that would be expected to cause this much failure to thrive by itself.  Have the current batch of\u00a0geraniums been fertilized since they were planted? They look nutrient-starved, though sometimes this is a function of root decline or soil acidity (pH) being outside a plant's preferred range rather than a lack of certain nutrients itself. Frustratingly, some toxicities from an overabundance of certain nutrients can look very similar to those of deficiencies.  In years past was there\u00a0a source of partial shade over the planters that is now gone? (Either the containers were moved to a sunnier spot, or maybe a tree was pruned, fell, or was removed?) High heat can stress geraniums and cause a leaf \"bleaching\"\u00a0type of symptoms, and different cultivars have different levels of sensitivity to temperature.  Once we have a little more information we can also consult with our plant pathologist to see if he recognizes these symptoms, though it may be a few days before we can\u00a0get his\u00a0feedback\u00a0as\u00a0he is currently unavailable at a horticulture conference.  Miri\nuser: Thank you for your thorough response to my question. I appreciate your good suggestions.We did completely change the potting soil in all the containers. (we thought the new soil would contain the necessary nutrients, so we didn\u2019t add fertilizer).We\u2019re not sure about the watering, although we are pretty much watering like we always did. We\u2019re checking the drainage. Until a couple of years ago we were putting stones at the bottom of the pots, because we thought that might help with drainage. We stopped doing that.It\u2019s interesting that you mentioned three shade.\u00a0 Two years ago we did cut down a tree that provided partial shade to the geraniums. Since we had 50 geraniums around the perimeter of our deck, some of them did not get that shade. But they are all now in full sun.Again, thank you for giving such attention to my question. I hope the information I provided is useful. I could take more photos if that would help.GretchenOn Mon, Jul 17, 2023 at 4:15 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nuser: One thing I forgot to mention, is that a while after we planted the geraniums, almost all the leaves turned red.

        "utterance": "Thank you for the additional information, Gretchen. Based on what you've shared, it seems like the removal of the tree and the resulting full sun exposure could be a significant factor, as geraniums can be sensitive to high heat and intense sunlight, especially if they were previously accustomed to partial shade. The red leaves you mentioned can be a sign of stress, often related to temperature extremes or nutrient deficiencies. Since you have already changed the soil, I recommend testing the soil pH to ensure it's within the optimal range for geraniums, which is typically between 6.0 and 6.5. Additionally, consider using a balanced liquid fertilizer to address any potential nutrient deficiencies. Monitor the watering closely, ensuring the soil is moist but not waterlogged, and check that the drainage is effective. If possible, provide some temporary shade during the hottest part of the day to see if that alleviates the stress. These steps should help improve the health of your geraniums. If the problem persists, further investigation into potential pests or diseases might be necessary.",

        "dialog_context": "user: About 10 years ago, we planted 3 Golden Thread False Cypress as foundation plants near our house.  The nursery tag stated that the height at 10 years would be 2-3 ft.  Well, they must like the location as they have grown much higher and wider.  Even with substantial trimming each year, they grow taller and wider than I would like. This year, they are about 5' high and 6' wide.  They seem to grow more than I can trim and still retain their graceful shape.  My Question:  Will the plants regenerate if I prune the bushes down to bare wood? I would prefer to keep the false cypress but they are getting out of hand. Thank you!\nexpert: Plant mature size information on tags can unfortunately be misleading, not necessarily because the nursery grower was being deceptive, but because lots of factors influence growth rate, and plants also never truly stop growing as they age (though they can slow down). Without the botanical and cultivar name of the plants you're growing, it's hard to say what their typical size winds-up being, but if they are 'Gold Mop' (a very widely-sold and widely-planted variety), then can easily mature in the 10-foot range once they are a couple decades old or so. (They're also usually much yellower than this picture implies...are they growing in full sun or does the exposure only receive morning or evening sun? More shade turns such yellow cultivars greener, and might also make them stay less compact.)  Unfortunately no, you can't prune them down to size or drastically cut them back to force regrowth. With very few exceptions, conifers (needled evergreens like cypress, pine, juniper, and spruce) cannot produce new growth on old wood. Branch wood that is several years old no longer has dormant growth buds that would be stimulated into growth by pruning, compared to broadleaf evergreens (holly, boxwood, etc.) that do. Therefore, when any style of pruning makes cuts back into wood that's more than a few years old, that cut is permanent and no regrowth fills back in.  If you want to keep the plants and have a space for them to grow larger without blocking a view or running into obstacles, you can transplant them (now is probably fine, or very early autumn or\u00a0next spring) out of this space. We can offer ideas for replacements if you'd like, though we'd need information about the site conditions in order to narrow-down some options. (How much direct summer sun it receives, how well-drained, damp, or dry the soil is, if deer browse in the area, and what mature size (without relying on pruning) the space can accommodate.)  Miri\nuser: Thank you so much for your reply! Unfortunately, we don't have an appropriate place to transplant but we would really appreciate your recommendations as to replacement plants. \u00a0The site is NNW in front of a low roofed breezeway, well-drained soil, gets morning and afternoon sun and deer grazing is a problem. \u00a0Mature size (without relying on pruning) of up to\u00a03.5'. We'd be open evergreen and/or deciduous plants. Thank you!\n",

        "utterance": "Inkberry Hollies (Ilex glabra) can be pruned to encourage a denser growth habit. If you trim the plant just above the green leaves, it can help stimulate new growth and potentially fill out the plant. However, if you cut below the green leaves into bare wood, it may not regenerate well, as hollies generally do not produce new growth from old wood. Transplanting the Inkberry to a sunnier location can indeed encourage it to fill out more at the bottom, as increased sunlight can promote denser foliage growth. Just ensure that the new location has well-drained soil and is not too dry, as Inkberries prefer moist conditions.",

        "dialog_context": "user: Hello UMD Extension, \r\n\r\nThis is year #1 for a newly built, raised-bed garden in my back yard in Cecil County, MD.  The soil is a 50/50 Mix of Compost and Topsoil from a local mulch company.  The garden is built into a hill, so bed depths start at 12\" and extend to approx. 2ft deep.  It's a \"U\" shaped garden, with the legs of the \"U\" measuring about 3.5' x 12.'  I water morning and evening, (as needed to keep the soil damp, but not puddling/soaked) targeting the base of the plants and trying to avoid the leaves.  \r\n\r\nThe Bell pepper plants in question were bought pre-started from either Lowes or a local Amish market and all appeared healthy when planted, roughly 18\" apart.  Green, Red, and Orange varieties.  They got planted late (Mid-June) but have been growing well, adding about a foot of height and a ton of peppers in the last month.  Suddenly (starting this weekend), two plants have begun to abruptly wilt, form the bottom-up, which seems to suggest a bacterial/fungal issue.  It seems if heat/water were the problem, the other plants would be showing signs as well, but seem to be doing OK so far.  The plants appeared completely healthy one day, 24 hours after, showed wilting in their lower leaves.  For the first couple of days, they would recover at night.  As of Tuesday/Wed/Thursday the wilt has persisted and gotten worse, to the point where the plant is pretty clearly dead.  \r\n\r\nThe photos attached show two affected plants. The one on the left is \"early stage\" wilting in the lower leaves, but with no real signs of spotting or dead tissue in the leaves or stalk.  The \"late stage\" plant (about 3-4 days ahead of the latter) shows the final, totally wilted result.  Even the fruits shriveled.   This plant does have some spots on the leaves.  I've attached photos of these as well, but they didn't show up until late in the death spiral! \r\n\r\nAny thoughts on what the cause could be?  Any way to avoid further spread?  It seems to be working its way down the row, and these peppers share a bed with tomatoes (another nightshade) so I'm worried they may be susceptible as well.\n",
        "decision": "<Respond>",
        "utterance": "Based on the symptoms you've described and the additional observations, it seems likely that your bell pepper plants are suffering from a root-related issue, possibly root rot or a vascular disease like Verticillium wilt or Fusarium wilt. The small root ball and the striation at the base of the stem could indicate a compromised root system, which might be exacerbated by the wet soil conditions. \n\nTo prevent further spread, consider the following steps:\n1. Remove and dispose of the affected plants to prevent the spread of any potential pathogens.\n2. Ensure proper drainage in your raised beds to avoid waterlogging, especially after heavy rains.\n3. Avoid overhead watering to minimize leaf wetness, which can promote fungal diseases.\n4. Consider rotating crops in the future to prevent soil-borne diseases from persisting.\n5. Monitor your other plants closely for similar symptoms and act quickly if they appear.\n\nIf the problem persists or affects more plants, you might want to have a soil test done to check for pathogens or nutrient imbalances. Additionally, consulting with a local extension office or a plant pathologist could provide more specific guidance based on your observations and the photos you've provided.",

There is always something going on in the garden. \u00a0It\u2019s never ending! I\u2019m not sure how you water or when, but early morning watering is the best. \u00a0The plants have a chance to dry out before the night. Spiderworts are susceptible to leaf spot, and plants start to decline once they get it. This generally won't kill the plants; as long as foliage is removed, the next re-sprouting should be clean. It looks like the patch is pretty dense. \u00a0If so, maybe consider thinning the plants out and starting more somewhere else or give them away. The daisies have something eating on them. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t look too bad, so if it gets no worse I wouldn\u2019t worry too much. \u00a0If you are worried, you could \u00a0apply a natural spray of dish soap and water in the cooler part of the day. \u00a0Insecticides may also work. \u00a0I can\u2019t tell you to use them, but if you do be sure to read the labe carefully, follow the instructions and be sure to check how it will affect the pollinators. My lilies are doing this same thing. \u00a0I believe the reason is they need to be thinned out and they may not be getting enough water. \u00a0With mine, by the end of July I can pull a lot of the bottom leaves off as they are done and brown. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t seem to hurt them. \u00a0I know I need to thin mine out. \u00a0Give them away or plant somewhere else. The watering goes for almost everything. \u00a0Soaker hoses are ideal depending on how much you have to water. \u00a0The same goes for thinning. \u00a0If something is struggling, maybe it needs to be thinned.

        "utterance": "Hi, Alex, the brown spots on your spiderwort are likely caused by a fungal leaf spot, which is not typically contagious to other plants. However, it can spread among the spiderwort plants themselves if conditions are favorable for the fungus. Thinning the plants can help improve air circulation and reduce the spread of the disease. After thinning, cutting back the spiderwort to remove all the diseased leaves is a good practice. This will help prevent the fungus from overwintering and reappearing next year. Make sure to dispose of the diseased leaves properly and avoid composting them to prevent further spread. Best of luck with your garden!",

        "utterance": "The early leaf color change in your Red Sunset Maple could be due to several factors. Given that other trees in the area are experiencing similar issues, environmental stressors such as drought, soil compaction, or nutrient deficiencies might be affecting them. The uneven and brittle bark could indicate stress or disease. It's good that you've checked for pests and found none. I recommend ensuring that the trees are receiving adequate water, especially during dry periods, and consider having a soil test done to check for nutrient deficiencies. Additionally, the metal cage around the tree could be restricting growth or causing damage, so it might be worth assessing its impact.

The longitudinal defect and misshaping suggest that the affected side of the apple may have experienced inhibited growth, possibly due to uneven water distribution or stress during critical growth periods. This can cause the cells on one side of the apple to grow less, leading to the misshapen appearance and cracking as the apple continues to develop. To mitigate this issue, ensure consistent watering, especially during dry spells, and consider mulching to retain soil moisture. Additionally, monitoring and adjusting nutrient levels might help improve overall fruit development. If the problem persists, consulting with a local extension service or a professional arborist for an on-site evaluation could provide more tailored advice.",

Some good options include golden ragwort (Packera aurea), which is a hardy perennial that thrives in shade and can help stabilize soil. Other options include ferns, hostas, and shade-tolerant grasses like sedges. Additionally, you might consider using erosion control blankets or mulch to protect the soil while the plants establish. It's also important to ensure proper drainage to prevent water from exacerbating the erosion. As for planting golden ragwort, the best time to plant is typically in the early spring or fall when the temperatures are cooler and the plants can establish roots before the heat of summer or the cold of winter.",

Carpenter bees are known to bore into wood to create nests, which can cause the round holes you described. The sawdust residue and soft wood are also consistent with their activity. To manage carpenter bees, you can try the following steps: \n\n1. **Preventive Measures**: Seal any existing holes with wood putty or caulk to prevent further nesting. Painting or varnishing exposed wood surfaces can also deter them, as they prefer untreated wood.\n\n2. **Insecticide Application**: Apply an insecticide specifically labeled for carpenter bees. This can be done by spraying or dusting the insecticide into the holes. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for safe and effective use.\n\n3. **Professional Help**: If the infestation is severe, consider hiring a pest control professional who has experience dealing with carpenter bees.\n\n4. **Regular Monitoring**: Keep an eye on the affected areas for any new activity and reapply treatments as necessary.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need more detailed guidance, feel free to ask!",

The root flare is where the roots start to spread out from the trunk, and it should be at or slightly above the soil line. If the root flare is buried, it can lead to poor air exchange and potential rot. Since you've already scraped off the soil to reveal the capillary roots, I would recommend gently removing any excess clay around the root flare to ensure it's exposed. Be careful not to damage the roots in the process. Afterward, you can add a layer of mulch around the base of the tree, but keep it away from the trunk to allow for proper air circulation.

I have a couple of questions\r\n1) Is my self-identified malady correct?\r\n2) what should we be doing with the trees to protect the open wounds?\r\n\r\nThanks, Cameron\nexpert: Oh no! Looks like there is a combination of things going on.\u00a0The trees look like they were planted too deep. There should be a root flare at the base.Yes, the cracking could have been from winter injury (freeze/thaw cycle).\u00a0I also see what could possibly be a disease issue called bleeding canker. This is caused by Phytophthora and is very common on maples. Some trees are able to live for a while with this condition. Take a look at that link and the photo-does that look like what you're seeing?\u00a0 There isn't much to be done but wait and see with these trees. How does the foliage look? Is the canopy thinning or any dieback?\nuser: Do you hve any recommendations that we follow up with to try to treat or extend the trees life? We have 3 large maples that I\u00a0would like to save from a terrible fate if we can?\nuser: If we remove these trees and plant new Maples will they be infected too? these are about 3 years old so I don't think we will be able to dig them up and raise them without causing further damage to them.\nexpert: Phytophthora is very common in our area. But it's hard to know just from a photo if that is what is affecting these trees. It could be that water is collecting in the cracks and causing some rot that is oozing out.  In this case, since the trees are established and the damage is so extensive\u00a0there isn't much that can be done. It's so sad to lose big trees, I have a lot of empathy for your situation!  How does the foliage look? Are you seeing any thinning or dieback? Does it look like the tree is starting to heal over the wounds at all? Can you pull back some of the mulch and see what the crown (base) looks like? Any decay at the base?\nuser: The foliage so far looks pretty good and there is no thinning that I can tell anyway. The wounds are new in the last couple months and they don't appear to have much if any rot in them yet. The crowns all look really good once we pulled the bark dust away from them. The trees do get hit from our lawn sprinklers when they are running in the mornings.\u00a0 Is there anything that I\u00a0could or should apply to the cracks to at least attempt to help them heal?\n",

        "utterance": "It's great to hear that the foliage looks healthy and the crowns are in good condition. Since the wounds have dried out, it's important to keep them dry to prevent further issues. Avoid using hydrogen peroxide or alcohol on the wounds, as these can damage the tissue and impede healing. Instead, focus on maintaining good tree health by ensuring proper watering (without wetting the trunk), mulching to retain soil moisture, and monitoring for any signs of disease or pest activity. If you notice any changes or worsening conditions, consulting with a local arborist for an on-site evaluation might be beneficial. Additionally, ensure that the trees are not planted too deeply, as this can contribute to stress and disease susceptibility.",

        "utterance": "It sounds like your trees might be suffering from root rot or a fungal infection, which can be exacerbated by the clay soil and heavy rain. Clay soil tends to retain water, which can lead to poor drainage and root issues. The browning of the trees could be a sign of Phytophthora root rot, a common problem in wet conditions. \n\nFor your Leland cypress, spraying with Bordeaux mixture can help prevent fungal infections, especially if you suspect a fungal issue. However, it's important to ensure good drainage and avoid overwatering. Since you've amended the soil, make sure it's not compacted and allows for proper drainage. \n\nRegarding your laurel bushes, they are generally more resistant to needle blight, but it's still important to monitor them for any signs of disease.

The only good part is that it's an annual that gets started anew each year (so pre-emergent products can prevent germination) and it\u00a0is easy to pull. It makes a lot of seeds, though, so even after controlling one year, it can be back the next. Cutting it low can encourage it to just flower and make seeds low... and you definitely don't want to keep making a 'dust storm' as it blows away your topsoil.

Unlike centipedes, millipedes do not prey on other insects like Symphylans. To manage them, you can try reducing moisture levels in your garden, as millipedes thrive in damp environments.

Insecticides applied in spring are one way to protect your tree from being re-injured in the future.\u00a0 For details, please see this CSU Fact Sheet:\u00a0https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/insects/white-pine-weevil-5-606/ I hope this is helpful!

HELP!!!\u00a0 We're in a bit of a panic.\nexpert: Hi, Harper, I think there might be more than one thing going on with the tree.\u00a0 The sticky substance is caused by a sap-sucking insect. Inspect the leaves and the twigs looking for aphids, which are tiny, light green insects, that will be feeding on the underside of leaves along the veins or at the base of the petiole, which is the stem of the leaf. Aphids can be dislodged with a spray of water from the hose. Chemicals are generally not warranted or recommended because aphids have so many natural predators that would also be affected by a chemical application.\u00a0 The tree may need water if you do not have a sprinkler system for the lawn. Watering yard trees once a week in the absence of rain is always a good practice to prevent drought stress. Water using a sprinkler to thoroughly soak the entire area under the branches while being careful to avoid directly and repeatedly\u00a0spraying the trunk.\u00a0  The light yellow dots may be the return of the leaf spot you mentioned, which could actually be caused by eyespot gall midge?\u00a0Could have been the spots you saw last year.

The same thing happened last year  in different soil and in a different spot.\nexpert: Hello, Avery, It is interesting that the same thing happened last year after pruning. The leaf tissue appears to be desiccated. Desiccation can occur from chemicals, or wind or sun damage. It could also be related to insufficient or incomplete watering. Do you clean your pruners before you prune? What do you use? Typical sanitizing cleaners are 10% bleach solution or rubbing alcohol. These typically do not affect the plant tissue. As part of pruning, do you fertilize or apply herbicides at the same time? Fertilizers are compounds that can desiccate the plant tissue. Errant herbicide can burn the tissue as well. The area that shows the bleaching \u2013 was that previously protected from the sun until other foliage was removed by pruning? If that leaf surface was protected, then all of a sudden was in strong sunlight, it could become sun scalded. Wind and sun can desiccate leaf tissue rapidly. Are these tomatoes in containers? Containers with good drainage can make it difficult to maintain good and consistent soil moisture. Too little irrigation could lead to stunted, dehydrated new growth. Beyond the bleached tissue, there does appear to be some fungal disease on leaves.  If this condition results in severe damage to your tomato plants, you may want to send a tissue sample to the MSU Diagnostic Labs to get a definite assessment of the cause. Take a tissue sample of any discolored foliage and send it to the MSU Diagnostic Labs for identification. The following website describes the services and the fee structure for analysis performed by the Diagnostic Lab.: https://www.canr.msu.edu/pestid/ This website provides directions and tips for taking a good sample: https://www.canr.msu.edu/pestid/submit-samples/\nuser: Thank you very much.\u00a0 Sent from my iPhone On Jul 14, 2024, at 9:15\u202fPM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:   \ufeff\n",

Since the leaves are dry and crunchy, it indicates that the plant is not getting enough water. I recommend switching from the gator bag to a more direct watering method. Water the hydrangea deeply at the base of the plant, ensuring the soil is moist but not waterlogged. During drought conditions, you may need to water more frequently, possibly every 3-4 days, depending on how quickly the soil dries out. Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger about an inch into the soil; if it feels dry, it's time to water. Additionally, consider adding a layer of mulch around the base of the plant to help retain moisture. Monitor the plant closely and adjust the watering schedule as needed based on the weather and soil conditions.",

If this is a community pond with a number of stakeholders/owners, I\u00a0don't recommend any individual resident take on herbicide application.\u00a0 Applying pesticides comes with a risk of liability, and it just isn't a good idea for a single resident to take that on for common property.\u00a0 In such cases, I\u00a0certainly recommend the association contract with a licensed applicator.\u00a0 When it comes to it, aquatic-labeled formulas of the herbicides\u00a0bispyribac, carfentrazone, diquat, flumioxazin, imazapyr, or penoxsulam should be effective.

        "utterance": "It's great that you've pruned the dying branch and are keeping the tree well-watered. For now, continue to monitor the tree closely. Ensure it receives consistent watering, especially during dry spells, but avoid overwatering. As for fertilization, since the tree was recently planted and fertilized at the time of planting, it might not need additional fertilizer immediately. However, if you notice the tree's growth is sluggish or the leaves are pale, a balanced, slow-release fertilizer could be beneficial. Apply it according to the package instructions, typically in early spring. Keep an eye out for any further signs of stress or disease, and feel free to reach out with more photos or updates.

Since you mentioned wrapping the trees, it's important to ensure that the wrapping is not causing any additional stress by trapping heat or moisture. As for fertilization, it's best to use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring before new growth begins. This will help support the trees throughout the growing season.

As for pruning, crabapple trees can generally tolerate pruning, but it's best to do so in late winter or early spring before new growth begins. Pruning in the fall can sometimes lead to increased susceptibility to winter injury. If the tree is healthy enough, you can prune it to remove dead or damaged branches and to shape it, but avoid severe pruning unless necessary.

Aphids can range in color from pink to yellow to green to black. The treatment for Aphids are listed below: Wash aphids from woody plants with a strong stream of water or by wiping the aphids off a stem or leaf by hand. Aphid populations tend to be higher in plants fertilized liberally with nitrogen or heavily watered, so avoid practices that produce flushes of succulent growth. There is a list of chemical control options as well such as insecticidal soap and horticultural oil. Please look only at the list column titled \"home landscape chemical products\" https://pnwhandbooks.org/insect/hort/landscape/common/landscape-aphid https://pnwhandbooks.org/sites/pnwhandbooks/files/insect/horticultural-landscape-ornamental/content/pdf/pdfs/insect23f-9chemicalcontrollandscapemrbawlbnk.pdf\nuser: Thanks for getting back to me, but this is not aphid damage.

        "decision": "<Respond>",
        "utterance": "It sounds like you're on the right track with using neem oil and soap, as these are effective organic treatments for both leafrollers and pear slugs. Since you prefer organic methods, another option you might consider is Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which is a natural bacterium that targets caterpillars like leafrollers without harming beneficial insects. You can apply Bt to the affected trees, ensuring thorough coverage of the leaves. Additionally, maintaining good garden hygiene by removing any fallen leaves or debris can help reduce overwintering sites for pests. Monitoring your trees regularly will also help you catch any new infestations early. Good luck, and feel free to reach out if you have more questions!",

These suckers grow from the rootstock and can be more vigorous than the grafted part of the plant. If left unchecked, they can outcompete the desired rose variety for nutrients and water, potentially harming the overall health and appearance of your rose bush. It is generally recommended to remove these suckers by cutting them as close to the root as possible to prevent regrowth. This will help ensure that your hybrid tea rose continues to thrive.

Generally, adding soil around the base of trees, especially over the graft union in grafted trees, can be harmful as it may lead to rot or other issues. For your citrus trees, it's crucial to keep the graft union exposed to prevent any potential problems. Since your planters have no bottoms, the roots can still access the ground, which is beneficial. Given that the trees are healthy and the soil addition is primarily for cosmetic reasons, it would be best to avoid adding soil up the trunk. Instead, consider other cosmetic solutions, such as using decorative mulch or stones around the base, ensuring they do not cover the graft union.

Have had other gardeners recently (including those on GrowWithKare11 facebook page), identify a plant we noticed last year on our hillside/yard, that is taking over the beautiful field grass we've grown accustomed to the last 30+ yrs. and slowly showing up elsewhere in our yard.  Majority all say it's Garlic Mustard.  Have no idea where it came from, but have been told to cut down before it flowers, get out at root if possible, but it's a long standing weed unfortunately.  Understand too it's edible, but a hillside of it, not appreciated. Many suggest Round Up applications for years.  Any other thoughts/suggestions would be appreciated!\n",
        "decision": "<Respond>",
        "utterance": "Garlic Mustard is indeed a challenging invasive species to manage. Here are some additional strategies you might consider: \n\n1. **Manual Removal**: Continue to pull the plants by hand, ensuring you remove the entire root system to prevent regrowth. This is most effective in early spring before the plants flower.\n\n2. **Mulching**: After removing the plants, apply a thick layer of mulch to suppress any new seedlings. This can be done with wood chips or straw.\n\n3. **Smothering**: You mentioned using plastic; both black and clear plastic can be effective. Black plastic will block sunlight and heat the soil, killing the plants underneath. Clear plastic can create a greenhouse effect, which also raises soil temperature to kill the plants. Ensure the edges are well-secured to prevent the plants from getting light.\n\n4. **Herbicide Use**: If you choose to use herbicides like Round Up, apply them in the fall when the plants are actively transporting nutrients to their roots. This can help ensure the herbicide reaches the root system.\n\n5. **Regular Monitoring**: Keep an eye on the area for new growth and address it promptly. Garlic Mustard seeds can remain viable in the soil for several years, so persistence is key.\n\n6. **Community Efforts**: Since Garlic Mustard can spread easily, consider coordinating with neighbors to manage it on a larger scale.\n\nThese methods, combined with patience and persistence, can help you regain control of your yard. Good luck!",

The differences in health and blooming could be due to several factors. First, the soil composition and drainage might still be affecting them, especially since heavy clay can retain water and affect root health. Ensure that the soil is well-draining and consider adding more organic matter if needed. The variation in blooms and health could also be due to the plants still establishing themselves after the move. It can take a couple of years for hydrangeas to fully settle and show consistent growth and blooming patterns. Additionally, the drooping plant with many blooms might be experiencing stress from the weight of the blooms or insufficient water uptake, so ensure consistent watering, especially during dry spells. Keep monitoring their progress, and with time, they should become more robust and bloom more consistently.",

First, ensure that the area around the boxwoods is well-ventilated and that there's good air circulation to help prevent the spread of the disease. Mulching is a good next step, as it can help retain soil moisture and suppress weeds, but make sure not to pile the mulch against the stems of the plants. Additionally, consider applying a fungicide specifically labeled for boxwood blight as a preventive measure. Keep an eye on the weather, as dry conditions can help slow the spread of the disease.

Based on the information and images, it seems like your maple tree might be experiencing stress, possibly due to environmental factors or disease, such as heart rot, which was previously mentioned. The early color change and leaf drop are signs of stress. For the crab apple, the leaf drop and thinning could be due to a variety of issues, including fungal diseases, pests, or environmental stress. While waiting for the arborist's visit, ensure both trees are receiving adequate water, especially during dry spells, and avoid any unnecessary pruning or fertilization that might further stress the trees. The arborist will be able to provide a more detailed assessment and recommend specific actions. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns in the meantime.",

        "utterance": "Based on the information provided, it seems that the lawn is experiencing stress due to a combination of factors. The low potassium level (90 ppm) is a concern, as potassium is crucial for grass health, particularly in stress tolerance and disease resistance. The high pH level of 7.6 can also affect nutrient availability, particularly for micronutrients. Additionally, relying solely on natural rainfall without supplemental irrigation during dry periods can lead to dormancy and stress. \n\nTo address these issues, consider the following steps:\n1. **Potassium Supplementation**: Apply a potassium-rich fertilizer to address the deficiency. Look for a fertilizer with a higher potassium content, such as a 0-0-60 (potash) product.\n2. **pH Management**: While the pH is slightly high, it may not be critical to adjust immediately. However, monitor the pH and consider using sulfur-based products if it continues to rise.\n3. **Irrigation**: Implement a supplemental irrigation plan during dry periods to prevent dormancy and stress. Aim for about 1 inch of water per week, including rainfall.\n4. **Fertilization Balance**: Ensure a balanced fertilization approach. While nitrogen is important, a balanced N-P-K ratio can help maintain overall lawn health.\n5. **Regular Monitoring**: Continue to monitor the lawn for any signs of disease or pest issues, as stressed lawns are more susceptible.\n\nBy addressing these factors, you should see an improvement in the lawn's health and resilience.",

I planted it in 2022 but moved it early this spring because I thought it might help resolve the issues if I made sure it was in the right place at the right depth, etc. It is planted it in well-drained, sandy soil where it gets full sun.  Unfortunately, I'm afraid I didn't help and might even have made the situation worse.  \r\n\r\nIt was looking pretty good through May, although its leader was drooping badly. I splinted it to straighten it up.  I also made sure to water it regularly through the heatwave in June.  However, since then the inside needles have turned brown and fallen off. I was afraid that I might have mulched it too excessively, so just last weekend I spread the mulch out more thinly.  Today, while watering it, I noticed some ants congregating on a few branches. I blasted them with water and saw what looks like a canker on one of the branches.  Oh no!  My question is, are the problems I'm seeing here cultural or disease related?  \r\n\r\nI looked at the needles under a magnifying glass and don't see any fungal spores, but I did have an old blue spruce removed from my  front yard this spring that was dying from needlecast and cytospora. Could that be afflicting this tree as well? \r\n\r\nI also wonder if I have been underwatering it.  I haven't given it much extra water in July since we've received and inch or more of rain pretty consistently each week. But maybe drought stress caused earlier is continuing to cause problems now?  \r\n\r\nI also noticed todat that there is some new growth coming off the trunk, so that gives me a bit of hope that this tree still has a shot.  I really want to do whatever I can to help this spruce thrive and appreciate any insight or suggestions you can offer. Thank you!\nexpert: Hi, Cameron, Thanks for the question. \u00a0It really doesn't look like this is disease related but it would be hard to tell from the pictures, the oozing wound could be a canker so removal of the limb would be the safe thing to do.\u00a0Look for vascular staining in the cutting.\u00a0The needle drop can be a result of heat stress due to\u00a0the unseasonably hot spring and early summer. Cytospora\u00a0can be a possibility down the line.\u00a0It can come from rain, wind, people, and birds.\u00a0The ants are most likely getting honeydew from aphids, soft scale, or adelgids. Once identified, consider treating. Take a look to determine what may be the source \u00a0\u00a0Sooty mold which grows on the honeydew\u00a0could also indicate where the ants are feeding.\u00a0 This tree has had a tough life being planted and replanted.\u00a0 The needles on the tree\u00a0appear to be healthy.\u00a0 It can take some time before the tree has developed a substantial root system.\u00a0 It is important to continue watering.\u00a0 In the spring, fertilizer can help.\u00a0\u00a0 Needle shedding in conifers - MSU Extension I hope this helps.\nuser: Thank you for your response and the link to the needle shedding article.\u00a0 That is very helpful. After I submitted my question, I did find aphids on 3 branches, so I will treat those with insecticidal soap asap.\u00a0 I will also remove the wounded branch out of caution since I have other conifer seedlings growing nearby.\u00a0 My only follow-up question is whether top dressing with a little bit of compost would be helpful. It did get a couple inches of Dairy Doo Tree and Shrub when I replanted it in early spring. I know we don't want to encourage tender new growth that will be susceptible to freeze damage, so is it too late in the year to top dress?\u00a0  I'm not going to give up on this fella yet, and hopefully everything I've learned from its struggles will make me a better conifer gardener.\u00a0\u00a0  Thanks so much for sharing your expertise.\u00a0   On Thu, Jul 25, 2024, 12:24\u202fAM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\n",

        "utterance": "It's great to hear that you're taking proactive steps to care for your white spruce. Given that you've already applied compost in early spring, it's generally advisable to avoid additional fertilization or top dressing with compost late in the growing season. This is because adding nutrients now could encourage new growth that might not harden off before winter, making it susceptible to freeze damage. It's best to wait until spring to apply more compost or fertilizer, which will support healthy growth as the tree comes out of dormancy. Keep up with regular watering, especially during dry spells, to help the tree establish a strong root system. Your dedication to learning and improving your conifer care is commendable, and I'm confident your spruce will benefit from your efforts.",

        "dialog_context": "user: Hi!\r\nI have about 25 rose bushes in my back yard. They get plenty of sunlight and water. The leaves are green, but they don\u2019t produce any roses at all - they haven\u2019t for the last 2-3 years. Any idea what the cause and cure might be?\nexpert: There are a number of possibilities, and some might be overlapping. One of our primary suspects with roses is deer...do any deer visit the yard or browse nearby overnight?\u00a0They are very fond of roses, especially flower buds. If deer are a problem, a physical barrier (netting or a fence) or a chemical barrier (repellents that make the plant smell/taste bad to them) would be needed, though repellents are not always permanently effective.  Are the shrubs pruned back each winter\u00a0(around February or so)? If not, that might be one reason they don't look very vigorous or balanced in shape. Shrub (non-climbing) roses are best pruned back to around 15-18 inches off the ground, more or less, each winter or very early spring so that they are stimulated to produce vigorous regrowth that should flower better than older wood.  Even setting aside the flowering issue, these plants look weak, like they are not growing well. You mention they get plenty of sun, but are they getting a full 6-8 or more hours worth of unobstructed summer sun? If not, that can reduce plant vigor and suppress bloom.  You also mention plenty of water...are they only being watered on an as-needed basis, based on checking the soil (and recent weather), or are they on some sort of irrigation cycle that runs on a programmed timer?\u00a0If the latter, they may be getting over-watered, in which case root loss can result in branch dieback, sparser foliage, and poor/no bloom. Ideally, the soil near the roots should be checked about six inches deep and watered well only when it's becoming somewhat dry to the touch at that depth. Roses aren't very tolerant of constantly-damp soil, and extra watering will also leach certain nutrients out of the soil faster than watering only occasionally. While routine fertilization of roses should not normally be necessary in most soils, a laboratory soil test may reveal a deficiency in that planting area that might benefit from supplemental fertilizer. (We can help to interpret test results if you choose to send a sample to one of the labs on that page.)  The close-up of a blasted (dead) bud and dying stem could have been caused by an infection, but it's hard to tell from the photo. You can explore our rose diagnostic page to see if any of the ailments common to roses in our area seem to be affecting your plants. Some rose varieties are more vulnerable to certain diseases than others, though even resistant plants\u00a0are not perfectly immune. If/when fungicides are warranted, they need to be applied preventatively to protect still-healthy growth, since they are not able to cure any existing disease. Several repeat applications per year, each year, are usually needed when a rose is particularly vulnerable to a given disease (black spot, for example).\u00a0Weak or infected branches can be pruned off and discarded (don't compost).  Miri\nuser: Wow\u2026 Thanks for the quick & thorough response! \u00a0  Deer are definitely an issue \u2013 we get lots of them. It\u2019s odd that they seemed to leave them alone for several years, but now they seem to have added them to their diet. \u00a0  Also, I have not been cutting them back in the late winter. I\u2019m guessing it would not be good to cut them back now? \u00a0  I only water them when there is a long dry spell, but I\u2019m glad to know that I should not risk over-watering them. \u00a0  I might look into a soil test and the diagnostic page. \u00a0  Again, thanks for your help!! \u00a0  Best, Dan\nexpert: You're welcome!  Deer are probably the main factor in this case, then, though the other conditions we mentioned bear looking into, since more than one problem can still overlap and affect the plants. Deer can change habits as they become more over-crowded or desperate for food (they generally don't eat the invasive plants taking over local woodlands). Additionally,\u00a0perhaps there were excluded from another property or area that they used to be able to browse in. Many deer in residential neighborhoods actually stay there their entire lives, rather than coming and going from wooded areas further away, so their diet depends on what they can find in home yards and wild spaces in between. You can try periodically spraying the rose foliage with repellents...it might be enough, at least to teach the deer that this isn't a plant they will find appealing. The trouble is that repellents wear off over time and in rain, and sometimes deer are too hungry to care, or just get used to the smell/taste and eat the plants they want to eat anyway, so it's an uphill battle.  Miri\nuser: Thanks!! \u00a0 Would it make sense to cut the bushes back now, or wait til nest February?\u00a0  Best, Dan\nexpert: Apologies -- you can do some pruning now, but lighter than the wholesale cutback that's usually\u00a0done in late winter...maybe shorten some stems a bit if they have sparse growth on the tips but are putting out new buds lower on the stem. You can also remove any spindly stems that are not putting out any leaves, if present.\u00a0Otherwise, it might be best to wait to prune\u00a0until they have more foliage and look lusher, since they need all the energy from photosynthesis they can get right now with such limited foliage.  Miri\nuser: Thanks!! \u00a0  Best, Dan\nexpert: You're welcome!\nuser: Hey, \u00a0  Just so you know, I took your advice regarding deer spray and fertilization and we are getting plenty of roses . \u00a0  I have another issue:  \u00a0  We bought three small hibiscus trees last year. They produced a lot of flowers all summer. In the fall, we brought them inside, so they\u2019d stay alive. They are alive and green, but they haven\u2019t produced any flowers. Is there something we can do to promote flowering? \u00a0THANKS!! Best, Dan\nexpert: Glad to hear the roses are recovering.  We presume these are tropical Hibsicus (also called Chinese Hibsicus,\u00a0Hibiscus rosa-sinensis)? We ask only because occasionally the hardy Rose-of-Sharon Hibiscus is trained into a tree form, though they are hardy shrubs. (They also don't start blooming until around midsummer or so.)  If these are the Chinese Hibiscus, they might need a little more time to resume blooming for this year. Are they situated in full sun or mostly sun? They grow and bloom best when getting enough light. Are the leaves still a dark green, or are they paler than you remember them being last year?\u00a0If paler, or if they've shed a lot of inner foliage over time but not produced much new foliage yet,\u00a0they may need fertilization (if you haven't applied any yet this season) to replace nutrients lost from the potting mix. In that case, any general-purpose flowering plant fertilizer should suffice, at the dosage recommended for container plants on the product label. Make sure they stay evenly moist (not soggy, but not so dry the plant wilts), since water stress can cause plants to abort flower buds mid-development.  Miri\nuser: Thanks so much, Miri!! \u00a0  Best, Dan\nexpert: You're welcome!\nuser: Hi! \u00a0  These hibiscuses are trained into a tree form. The trunk is \u201cbraided\u201d; the total height is around 4 feet. The leaves look healthy; they get plenty of sun. I added Miracle Grow to the water. I am not over watering\u2026 Still no flowers on any of them\u2026 \u00a0  Any suggestions? \u00a0  Best, Dan\nexpert: Hello, Riley,  Can you share photos of the plants? It's hard to guess at a diagnosis from the description, in that it doesn't sound like anything is wrong with the plants. Sometimes it can be hard to ascertain why a plant is stubbornly not blooming when it appears to be getting all that it needs, but we'll see if something jumps out at us in the photos. Can you relay the N-P-K analysis of the fertilizer you're using? (For example, 5-10-5.) If it's much higher on nitrogen (the first number in the series) than phosphorus and potassium (example, 10-3-2), maybe that's stimulating leaf growth at the expense of flowers.  Miri\nuser: Hi! \u00a0  Thanks for the quick response \u2013 You spoil me . \u00a0  Here is a pic of one of the plants and one of the plant food. The plants are in the same soil that they came in when I bought them in the spring of 2023.  What do you think? \u00a0Best, Dan\nexpert: The pot they are planted in (that they were sold in, it sounds) might be restricting growth since they may be outgrowing the container. A plant this size might benefit from getting bumped-up into a container one size larger (or maybe a little bit bigger...a jump of one pot size generally involves a pot 1-2 inches wider in diameter). Whichever container you might choose to transplant them into, make sure it has at least one unobstructed\u00a0drainage hole. The decorative pot it's sitting inside might actually work well, if it's available and drained. You can use regular (nothing special) potting mix to fill-in around the current root ball, making sure to loosen any tangled roots up a bit before putting it into new soil. Keep the depth at which it's planted the same as it is now.  The fertilizer shown is high in nitrogen, though that alone might not be a factor (or sole factor) in reluctant blooming. Normally, Chinese Hibiscus foliage is larger, denser, and darker green than what is pictured, so maybe the plants are getting a bit anemic, which could be related to root room as much as nutrient availability. Don't over-dose the plants\u00a0(use whatever dilution and application frequency the package instructs), but the plant might need more time to put those supplemental nutrients to good use, since it looks like it needs to catch-up on foliage growth to support blooming.  We can't tell from the front label on the fertilizer if it contains \"micronutrients,\" which include elements like iron, magnesium, and manganese. The\u00a0\"micro\"\u00a0in micronutrients refers to their proportional dosages for what plants need, not that they're any less important to overall health. Leaves yellower-green than is typical might be due to a near-deficiency in one or more of those elements. Some fertilizer formulations contain \"micros\"\u00a0and others do not. In the ground, a fertilizer lacking them isn't usually a problem, since they are plentiful, but in pots, plant roots have limited resources and their depletion can be more likely. A change in soil acidity (pH) can affect nutrient uptake by roots, but we doubt anything has changed that drastically (if at all) in the potting mix to make this something to investigate. Potting mixes are generally formulated to be at the ideal level of slightly-acidic anyway unless an additive like lime or sulfur throws them off; not something we expect that you would have applied.  Are the pots being checked for watering needs daily?\u00a0While they may or may not need daily watering at this point\u00a0(depends on the weather and how root-bound they are), if a plant gets too dry too often, even if not yet wilting (or even if it recovers well after wilting), flower buds that might be in development can be aborted as a response to the stress. While this tends to happen on buds that are already large enough to be visible, it might be happening earlier in their development. The University of Minnesota says that high temperatures can contribute to bud drop in Chinese Hibiscus, but anecdotally they seem to bloom decently well during Maryland summers, so that might not be the sole factor.

The chlorosis and browning of leaf tips suggest that the tree might not be getting enough water or nutrients. Since the tree is on a slope, water might be running off before it can be absorbed effectively. I recommend increasing the watering frequency slightly, especially during hot, dry periods, to ensure the tree is getting enough moisture. Additionally, consider applying a balanced fertilizer to address any potential nutrient deficiencies. It might also be helpful to check the soil pH, as hawthorns prefer slightly acidic to neutral soil.

        "utterance": "Based on the symptoms you've described, it sounds like your plants might be affected by a fungal disease such as black rot or downy mildew, which are common in brassicas and can also affect other leafy greens. The black line moving up the stem and the yellowing of veins are indicative of black rot, while the twisting and buckling could be signs of downy mildew. Since you are practicing crop rotation and have full sun exposure, these cultural practices are already helping to reduce disease pressure. However, given the severity and spread of the symptoms, it would be prudent to send a plant tissue sample to a lab for accurate diagnosis. This will help confirm the specific pathogen and guide you in implementing targeted control measures. You can contact the OSU Plant Clinic for assistance with this process. In the meantime, ensure good air circulation around your plants and avoid overhead watering to minimize moisture on the leaves, which can exacerbate fungal issues.",

        "utterance": "The Klinki Pine (Araucaria hunsteinii) is indeed a large tree native to Papua New Guinea, and it can grow quite tall. Since you have it indoors, it's important to ensure it has enough space to grow. Pruning can be done to manage its size, but it should be done carefully to avoid stressing the plant. It's best to prune during the tree's dormant period, which is typically in late winter or early spring. As for transplanting, if the tree is root-bound or the pot is too small, moving it to a larger pot can promote healthier growth. Ensure the new pot has good drainage and use a well-draining soil mix. Keep in mind that the Klinki Pine prefers a humid environment, so maintaining adequate humidity indoors is also beneficial. Regularly check for pests and provide sufficient light, as these are crucial for its health indoors.",

        "utterance": "To protect your peach trees from birds, you can try several methods. One effective approach is to use bird netting to cover the trees, which physically prevents birds from reaching the fruit. Make sure the netting is securely fastened and covers the entire tree. Another option is to use reflective tape or objects, such as old CDs or aluminum foil strips, which can deter birds due to the light reflections. Additionally, you can use scare devices like fake predators or noise makers, but these may need to be moved regularly to remain effective. Combining several methods often yields the best results. Good luck with your peach trees!",

        "utterance": "Based on the information provided, it seems like your dogwood tree might be experiencing stress due to environmental conditions, particularly the full-sun exposure. Dogwoods typically prefer partial shade, especially in hotter climates, as too much direct sunlight can lead to leaf scorch, which matches the symptoms of leaf cupping and dying leaves. Here are a few suggestions to help your tree recover:\n\n1. **Mulching**: Apply a layer of mulch around the base of the tree to help retain soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.\n\n2. **Watering**: Ensure the tree is receiving adequate water, especially during dry spells. Water deeply once a week rather than frequent shallow watering.\n\n3. **Shade Protection**: Consider providing some temporary shade during the hottest part of the day, especially in the afternoon, to reduce stress from direct sunlight.\n\n4. **Fertilization**: Avoid fertilizing the tree until it shows signs of recovery, as fertilization can sometimes exacerbate stress.\n\n5. **Monitor**: Keep an eye on the tree for any new symptoms or changes, and continue to prune any dead or diseased branches.\n\nIf the condition does not improve, you may want to consult with a local arborist or extension service for further evaluation.

Since you've ruled out sucking insects and noted that the problem is specific to the plants in cinder blocks, it might be related to the growing conditions. Ensure that the plants have adequate drainage and are not overcrowded, as this can lead to increased humidity and fungal growth. For treatment, you can use a fungicide that is safe for pollinators, such as those containing neem oil or sulfur. These are generally considered safe for beneficial insects when used as directed. Additionally, try to water the plants at the base to avoid wetting the foliage, which can exacerbate fungal issues. Regularly remove any affected leaves to prevent the spread of the disease.",

One is an orange color beetle type of bug, kind of like a lady bug but definitely not a lady bug.  The other was a small, thin bug without an exoskeleton with blue and yellow markings on the back and no wings, looking kind of like a larvae og something with no wings.  I have attached an unfortunately blurry picture of the bugs on the plant.  I have also noticed that my neighbors are having the same issue.

How can I prevent this from happening again?\n",
        "decision": "<Respond>",
        "utterance": "Based on the symptoms you've described, it sounds like your yellow day lilies may be suffering from a combination of fungal disease and pest infestation. The white powdery substance is likely powdery mildew, a common fungal disease that thrives in overcrowded conditions with poor air circulation. The rot at the base of the plants could be due to a root or crown rot, which is exacerbated by wet conditions and poor drainage. The orange beetle-like bug might be a lily leaf beetle, which is known to feed on lilies, while the other insect could be a type of larvae that also feeds on plant material.\n\nTo address these issues, here are some steps you can take:\n1. **Improve Air Circulation:** Thin out your day lilies to reduce overcrowding, which will help improve air circulation and reduce the likelihood of fungal diseases.\n2. **Remove Affected Material:** Continue to remove and dispose of any infected plant material to prevent the spread of disease.\n3. **Monitor and Control Pests:** Keep an eye out for the beetles and larvae. You can handpick them off the plants or use an appropriate insecticide if necessary.\n4. **Fungicide Application:** Consider applying a fungicide to help control the powdery mildew. Be sure to follow the instructions on the label for safe and effective use.\n5. **Improve Drainage:** Ensure that your soil has good drainage to prevent root rot. You might need to amend the soil or adjust your watering practices.\n\nWith these measures, your yellow day lilies should have a good chance of recovering and regrowing next year. It's also a good idea to keep an eye on your neighbor's plants and share this information with them, as they might be facing the same issues.",

        "utterance": "It sounds like you have taken several good steps in planting and caring for your Doublefile Viburnum. The uneven leafing and wilting could be due to a few factors. First, it's possible that the plant is still adjusting to its new environment, especially since it was planted while dormant. The difference in leafing could be due to microclimatic variations or slight differences in soil conditions around the roots. Given that you mentioned the site is well-draining and at the top of a slope, overwatering might not be a major issue, but it's still worth monitoring the soil moisture to ensure it's not too wet. You might want to check the soil moisture at different depths and locations around the plant to ensure even moisture distribution. Additionally, consider the possibility of transplant shock, which can cause some branches to struggle more than others. Continue to monitor the plant, and if the wilting persists or worsens, you might want to check for any signs of pests or diseases. Adjusting the watering schedule slightly, as you mentioned, could also help the plant establish more evenly.",

If you choose to plant it now, ensure that the site is well-drained and receives partial shade, as dogwoods prefer these conditions. Planting now, in late spring, can be successful if you are diligent about watering, especially during dry spells, to help the tree establish. However, if you prefer to wait until fall, you can keep the tree in its pot, ensuring it is watered regularly and protected from extreme heat or wind. Fall planting is often recommended as it allows the tree to establish roots before the stress of summer heat.

Did you take a leaf or soil sample that indicated low iron? Are these fall bearing raspberries or summer bearing raspberries? At first glance this appears to be spur blight, a fungal disease. Spur blight starts in the leaves and then can move into the canes. This can be mitigated culturally by increasing airflow by training canes apart or pruning out dense growth and using ground or drip irrigation as opposed to sprinkler irrigation. Remove any dead or infected canes from your planting. I like to recommend the University of Minnesota's extension guide on raspberry cane diseases as a resource.\nuser: Thank you for your response.\u00a0 I added iron because of the yellowing leaves but didn't have any results from a leaf or soil sample.

        "utterance": "Thank you for the additional information, Christy. Given that your raspberries are 'Heritage everbearing' and considering the symptoms, it's possible that the reduced sunlight and clay-heavy soil are contributing to the issues. Everbearing raspberries like 'Heritage' benefit from full sun and well-drained soil. The clay soil can retain too much moisture, which might exacerbate fungal issues like spur blight. Improving drainage and ensuring adequate sunlight by pruning surrounding trees could help. Additionally, consider testing your soil to check for nutrient deficiencies or pH imbalances. Since you've already seen some improvement with iron, a comprehensive soil test might reveal other nutrient needs. Also, ensure that your irrigation practices avoid wetting the foliage to reduce fungal disease risk. If spur blight is confirmed, removing infected canes and improving air circulation will be crucial. Feel free to reach out if you have more questions or need further assistance!",

I sprayed them with horticultural oil throughout the summer and they seemed better but now they look like they\u2019re dying. The same thing Seems to be happening to my jasmine, my photinia and a very large spring blooming camellia. A separate question involves crape myrtle bark scale. I had a very small infestation last summer. The trees were treated professionally in the fall and again last month. There are still small remnants. Is this something that I need to treat for regularly?\nexpert: We don't see any insects on the first photo sample of camellia leaves. The scattered pockmarks on the undersides of the leaf are not due to insect damage and are not an infection that will cause the plant any damage, so they can be ignored. If you see other indications of suspected insect damage, or insects themselves, please feel free to send additional photos. Cottony Camellia Scale tends to be one of the only insects of concern on camellia shrubs; you can learn what to look for on the linked page.  If camellia plants are struggling to do well, it may be related to growing conditions instead, such as roots staying too wet or the plant growing in soil that is not acidic enough. (Is it near a roof downspout outlet that puts extra water into the root zone?\u00a0Is the plant near lawn that has lime applied every couple of years, or close to a building whose foundation might be leaching into the soil, raising the pH?) Horticultural oil might suppress a mite outbreak, if they were present and causing damage, but otherwise it should not be needed and won't be of much use for suppressing other insects. (It can help with scale, but only at certain times of year when the scale insects are most vulnerable.) Spraying horticultural oil in summer can risk leaf damage if it is applied in hot weather.  Can you send us a photo of the entire camellia shrub so we can see its symptoms? We can't see what kind of plant is pictured in the third photo, or what symptoms are being shown, because it's not in focus.  We don't see jasmine samples in any of the photos.

Very few jasmine plants are winter-hardy in\u00a0Maryland; most are indoor plants.\u00a0  The second picture of Photinia leaves appears to show a very common leaf spot disease that this shrub almost always seems to contract in our region, though it can be worse in years with wet weather. It is an eyesore, but doesn't necessarily kill the plant, though recurring bouts of heavy infection can cause leaf drop and weaken the shrub. Only a fungicide labeled for suppression of this disease (Entomosporium fungus), applied preventatively and repeatedly through much of the growing season, can reduce infection. It would have to be redone every year, so that degree of management and expense usually makes Photinia not worth growing in our opinion.  Crapemyrtle Bark Scale will be an ongoing problem if present in the area and infestations can take a while to successfully control. Plus, since crawlers (the juvenile stage that moves from plant to plant on the wind or via bird or squirrel fur/feet) can recolonize the plant at any time in the future, periodic monitoring needs to continue for the life of the plant. Given how abundantly this non-native tree/shrub is planted in Maryland gardens, this scale will probably be an issue well into the future.  How often a treatment is used depends on the chemical applied. You mention that the plant was treated professionally twice so far; did the company/applicator give you information on what they used? Some applications may need to be made several times per year whereas others might last a year or more per application.\u00a0Systemic insecticides, which are absorbed into the plant's tissues, tend to last longer, but also might carry a risk of contaminating the plant's next set of flowers (nectar/pollen), potentially putting pollinators at risk. Another factor to keep in mind is that dead scale won't necessarily fall off the plant right away, so a treatment might be working to kill the insects, but it won't necessarily be obvious for some time, since the white waxy/fluffy material the insects generate could stay stuck on the bark until it finally weathers away.  Miri\nuser: Hi, Charlie,Thank you for the quick reply. I\u2019ve attached a photo of the entire camellia shrub and of the tops of the leaves. None of the other possible factors is present, so it may be the soil pH.\u00a0I apologize. The jasmine is actually Carolina jessamine. I had so many people thell me they\u2019re the same I started to believe it. They\u2019ve done very well and are covered with flowers. The second and third photos are of one the tendrils.I agree that the photinia may have to go.I\u2019ll have to ask the arborist what was used on the crape myrtles. It\u2019s not on the invoice. The info you gave about scale was very useful.Thank you again,AmandaOn Apr 12, 2024, at 4:16 PM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nexpert: Hello, Morgan,  Thank you for the new photos. The camellia foliage color suggests either general stress (perhaps root zone, like competition with the aggressive groundcovers or moisture level or pH). However, it's not uncommon for camellias exposed to winter sunshine (if they are shaded by trees in summer) to cause leaf color fading. Is this shrub receiving several hours of summer sun, or is it shaded during the midday/afternoon hours once any overhead trees leaf-out? If they get too much sun, sometimes camellia foliage becomes yellower, though in that situation there's still often another factor at work.  The ringed patches are suspect and we will show them to our plant pathologist early next week and let you know what he thinks. Our initial impression is that they are caused by a virus, and if so, plant viruses are incurable, though not always fatal to a plant. When a plant contracted a viral infection can be difficult to determine, though insect feeding as well as tools contaminated with sap from another infected plant can be typical routes of transmission.  The spots on the Jessamine foliage don't look concerning, and as a semi-evergreen plant (one which keeps at least some leaves in winter), some degree of leaf degradation by the end of winter is typical on a variety of evergreens. We'd expect they will either shed later in spring, once new foliage emerges, or they may hang on for a while but will be more covered-up by new growth.  If you wish to test the soil pH, we suggest having it done by a soil testing lab since home test kits are more difficult to use and may produce inaccurate results. We can help to interpret the lab results if desired.  Miri\nuser: Hi, Charlie,I\u2019ll be very interested to know what the pathologist says. The camellias are shaded in the afternoon when the leaves come out on the trees. I have ordered a soil test kit from one go the labs on the list.Thank you,AmandaOn Apr 12, 2024, at 6:11 PM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\n",

Answers to your questions below:   The blooming was a normal amount with no discoloration on the blossoms  I pruned off a bunch of dead branches last year and a few little ones this spring.  I have no idea how old the tree is. I moved into the house in 2019. It seems like it has been here awhile.  I believe I noticed it last year, but I thought it was because of the drought.

        "utterance": "Based on the information provided, it seems like your lilac tree might be experiencing a fungal infection, such as powdery mildew or leaf spot, which are common in lilacs. The symptoms you describe\u2014brown, spotted, and dead leaves\u2014are consistent with these issues. Since you mentioned that the leaves improved with rain last year, it could also be related to environmental stress, such as drought. \n\nTo treat the tree, ensure it is well-watered, especially during dry spells, but avoid overwatering as lilacs prefer well-drained soil. You can also apply a fungicide specifically labeled for use on lilacs to help manage any fungal infections. Pruning to improve air circulation can also help reduce fungal issues. Make sure to remove and dispose of any fallen leaves to prevent the spread of disease. If the problem persists, consider consulting a local arborist for a more detailed assessment.",

I am one of your MOCO Ask Extension colleagues, and my Master Gardener colleagues could use your help in determining what is affecting some of our plants.\r\n\r\nI help manage six cutting garden beds in the Demonstration Garden in Derwood.  Earlier this season, we observed that small portions of the conoclinium coelestinum were turning black and dying, but the rest of the plants were, and remained, healthy.  We cut down the affected stalks to the ground, but that was all.  Occasionally over the summer the condition recurred, but was confined to the conoclinium.\r\n\r\nToday, however, I observed that the condition has spread to other beds in the garden.  A large stand of phlox Jena was completely destroyed, and a clump of phlox David next to it also was affected (fortunately, the rest of the David was unaffected and continues to flower nicely).  I also found a good amount of the condition in leucanthemum 'Becky'.  I should note that these affected beds are not next to each other and in fact are a good 30 to 50 feet apart.  Other plants in beds in between the affected areas  are fine and disease free.\r\n\r\nI asked other MGs what they thought might be happening, but no one knew for sure.  We all agreed it looked like a disease (no sign of insect infestation), perhaps fungal given that the bottoms of the affected stalks turn black and moist, like they're rotting.  The attached photos will give you an idea.  (I have more photos, but the system will only allow me to attach these three.)  If it's a fungus, perhaps it's been exacerbated by the alternating dry and wet weather we've had.  I've been working in these beds for many years, and I have never encountered this before.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think is causing this?  Is there a treatment?  As mentioned, we've confined ourselves to cutting down the affected stalks to the ground--since these are perennials we've avoided pulling them out by their roots.\r\n\r\nYour help will be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nBob Loesche\nexpert: Hi, Emerson,\u00a0 Our plant pathologist had a look and agrees that\u00a0cutting back the foliage is helpful\u00a0and also recommended digging one or a little section of one - maybe the part of the plant where the rest looks healthy still (\u00a0try to take a spade and cut that wedge of the plant and roots out) so you\u00a0can examine it for Southern Blight nodules on the roots.\u00a0 It could also be a wilt disease like Verticillium which given the weather patterns like you mentioned could have stressed the plants and caused the infection and in that case they would have to be removed. Did you notice any reddish center or streaking in the cut stems? Maybe you could cut some more to look.\u00a0 Garden phlox unfortunately get so many ailments so it is difficult to say for sure when they are this far gone.\u00a0 Examine some of the roots and see if you notice anything and feel free to send more photos.\u00a0 Emily\nuser: Emily, thanks so much for your prompt response.\u00a0 I will look more closely at the plants as you suggest.\u00a0 Unfortunately my colleagues and II won't be back in Derwood until next Tuesday, but I'll keep you posted as to what we find.

        "utterance": "Hi, Emerson, based on the symptoms and the photos provided, it does seem likely that a fungal disease could be affecting your plants. Overwatering can indeed contribute to root rot, especially if the soil remains consistently wet, which can create an environment conducive to fungal growth. Since you mentioned the drip line system might not be precise, it would be wise to monitor the moisture levels in the soil to ensure they are not excessively wet. In addition to cutting down affected plants, you might consider improving drainage in the affected areas and applying a fungicide if a specific fungal pathogen is identified. It would also be beneficial to continue monitoring for any signs of Southern Blight or Verticillium wilt, as these would require different management strategies. If you can confirm the presence of these diseases, removing and destroying affected plants is crucial to prevent further spread. Let me know if you have any more questions or need further assistance!",

There's a disease, Rhizoctonia, that is called \"wirestem\" because it causes the stems of young plants to be pinched near the soil line.\u00a0It causes stunting and wilting for the reason you mentioned and plants usually die.  http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/IPM/english/peppers/diseases-and-disorders/damping-off.html (top photo)  The fact that your root systems and lower stem tissue\u00a0look fine and the brown, pinched area is high up on the stem, makes us think that it\u00a0may have been caused by something rubbing against the stem or\u00a0by\u00a0insect feeding.\u00a0  There is no fixing the problem.\u00a0We'll be curious to know if your plants somehow outgrow the injury. Jon\nuser: Thanks for the response!\u00a0Maybe this could provide additional insights. Spotted two of these insects on different plants right by the brown stem. Any idea what this is and what can kill and prevent them from coming\nexpert: Hi- we no longer have an entomologist on staff (lost to budget cut at the beginning of the pandemic) and cannot ID the insect. It is possibly the larva of a type of tortoise beetle. In any case, the insect in the photo is not a serious pest and probably did not cause the pinched stem issue. Jon\nuser: Thank you for the quick response. I reached out to my entomologist group I joined after you responded . Someone was able to identify it and it looks just like what I saw and the damage is the same.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the pest and additional details. Will have to treat the garden I believe .

        "utterance": "It sounds like you've identified the Threecornered Alfalfa Hopper as the pest affecting your plants. Spinosad is a good choice for controlling this pest, as it is effective against a wide range of insects and is considered safe for use in gardens. When applying spinosad, make sure to follow the label instructions carefully, especially regarding the concentration and application method. It's important to cover both the plants and the soil, as you've planned, to ensure that you target both the insects on the plants and any larvae in the soil. Additionally, consider applying it in the early morning or late afternoon to minimize the impact on beneficial insects. Keep monitoring your plants for any signs of improvement or further damage, and reapply as necessary according to the product guidelines. Good luck with your garden treatment!",

        "utterance": "Based on the information provided and the identification of leafhoppers as the pests, it's likely that the white/yellow spots on your oregano and sage are due to leafhopper feeding. Leafhoppers can cause damage by sucking sap from the leaves, leading to the spotting you observe. Here are some steps you can take to manage the situation:\n\n1. **Physical Removal**: If the infestation is not severe, you can try removing the leafhoppers manually or using a strong jet of water to dislodge them from the plants.\n\n2. **Insecticidal Soap or Neem Oil**: These are organic options that can help control leafhopper populations. Apply according to the product instructions, ensuring thorough coverage of the affected plants.\n\n3. **Improve Air Circulation**: Since your plants are crowded, consider thinning them out or relocating some to improve air circulation, which can help reduce pest problems.\n\n4. **Monitor and Maintain**: Keep an eye on your plants for any further signs of pest activity and maintain good garden hygiene by removing any debris or heavily infested leaves.\n\nIf the problem persists or worsens, you might consider consulting with a local extension service for more targeted advice.

The common burdock can be found everywhere in Minnesota but there are three varieties and all of them are invasive and should be eradicated. Here is information about all three types from Minnesota Wildflowers. You could cut one of the stems to see if it's hollow or not. If not hollow, it is the likely newer variety called Actium lappa.  Good-luck! eGardener  Replied June 28, 2024, 12:26 PM EDT Thank you so much for researching this for me. \u00a0The leaves do look similar to the Great Burdoch. \u00a0Leaves on the other 2 are too pointy. \u00a0I don\u2019t see any branchy stem coming up or flower buds. \u00a0I got this seedling in April.Perhaps this matures late summer? \u00a0Being as it is contained in a pot on my patio I will let it mature to see what it does. \u00a0Should be interesting. \u00a0Thank you again for naming my Mystery Plant and letting me know I shouldn\u2019t plant it in the garden!\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Vicki NielsenThe Question Asker Replied June 28, 2024, 1:15 PM EDT\n",

        "utterance": "Based on your description and the images provided, it does seem likely that your plant is a Great Burdock (Arctium lappa). This plant is known to mature in late summer, which might explain the absence of flowers or a branchy stem at this time. Since it is an invasive species, it's good that you are keeping it contained in a pot. If you decide to let it mature, keep an eye on it to prevent it from spreading seeds. If you notice any flower buds forming, you might want to remove them to prevent seed dispersal. If you decide to dispose of the plant, ensure that you do so responsibly to prevent it from spreading in your area. Feel free to reach out if you have more questions or need further assistance!",

Brown patch is a common lawn disease caused by the fungus Rhizoctonia solani. To manage brown patch, ensure your lawn is not overwatered and improve air circulation by mowing at the recommended height for your grass type. Avoid fertilizing with high nitrogen fertilizers during the summer months, as this can exacerbate the problem. Since you've had success with Strobe pro fungicide, you might consider reapplying it according to the label instructions, ensuring you cover the affected areas thoroughly. Additionally, consider rotating fungicides to prevent resistance buildup. If the problem persists, consulting with a local extension service or a lawn care professional for a more tailored approach might be beneficial.",

Be cautious not to disturb the soil too much, as this can bring any buried seeds to the surface.\n\n2. **Mulching**: After removing the dead plants, consider applying a layer of mulch.

If you notice any new growth, remove it promptly to prevent it from establishing.\n\n4. **Pre-emergent Herbicide**: In early spring, you might consider applying a pre-emergent herbicide to prevent any seeds from germinating.\n\nBy following these steps, you can reduce the chances of creeping charlie re-establishing in your garden.",

I have researched your question and have a couple answers for you. First, the clover is showing signs of stress from the heat we have had. That is the red and yellow on the leaves. When you water, it is best to water deeply and less frequently. This has been a challenging summer with the extreme heat, humidity, and rain. Some plants love it, others not so much! I have also learned it is better to plant some grass with the clover, as the clover will often die back in late summer. You can also lose some clover over winter.\u00a0Perhaps you can add some grass if you are not opposed to this. I hope this is helpful, thank you! Cynthia MGV\nuser: Hi, Avery,  Yes, it\u2019s been such a hot summer! Thanks so much for your response.

        "utterance": "Hi, Quinn, it's great to hear from you again! Mowing clover can indeed be beneficial, especially if it's getting tall and overcrowded. Generally, it's recommended to wait until the clover is well-established before mowing, which usually means waiting until it has flowered at least once. Since you planted in early June and it's now late summer, your clover should be established enough to handle mowing. When you do mow, set your mower to a higher setting to avoid cutting too much of the plant at once. This will help maintain its health and encourage it to spread. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Best, Cynthia MGV",

        "utterance": "Hello, Jamie,\n\nIt's good that you've managed to keep the bark in place with thick string, as this can help the tree heal by keeping the cambium layer protected. However, it's important to ensure that the string is not too tight, as this could further damage the tree. Over time, the tree will attempt to heal itself by forming callus tissue over the damaged area.\n\nUsing wood mulch around the base of the tree is an excellent idea, as it helps retain moisture and protect the roots. Just make sure the mulch is not piled against the trunk, as this can lead to rot.\n\nA white tree protector can be beneficial, especially in preventing sunscald and further mechanical damage. It can also help in reflecting sunlight and keeping the trunk cooler.\n\nRegarding sprays, it's generally not recommended to apply any sealants or sprays to the damaged area, as they can trap moisture and potentially lead to decay. Instead, focus on keeping the tree healthy by watering it during dry periods and ensuring it has adequate nutrients.\n\nIf you notice any signs of disease or pest infestation, it might be worth consulting with a local arborist for further advice.\n\nBest regards,\nAmy",

The presence of bore holes at the base of the shrub is concerning and could indeed indicate an infestation by borers, such as the Greater Peachborer. This pest can cause significant damage by tunneling into the wood, disrupting the plant's ability to transport water and nutrients. The tiny black spots on the leaves could also suggest a fungal issue, which might be secondary to the stress caused by the borers. \n\nI recommend continuing to monitor the laurels closely and maintain consistent watering, especially during dry periods. It might be beneficial to apply a systemic insecticide specifically targeting borers, but please ensure it is safe for use on laurels and follow the manufacturer's instructions. Additionally, consider consulting with a local arborist or pest control specialist to confirm the presence of borers and discuss treatment options. If the problem persists, a sample analysis by a plant clinic could provide a definitive diagnosis. Let me know if you need further assistance or if you'd like to arrange another visit.

Based on your description and the images, it seems like the weed could potentially be Lindernia dubia, also known as False Pimpernel. This plant is known for its small white flowers and can be quite persistent in gardens. However, without a definitive scale in the images, it's challenging to confirm this identification with absolute certainty. \n\nRegarding your question about the weed possibly coming in with peat, it's unlikely but not impossible. Peat can sometimes carry seeds, but it's more common for weeds to spread through other means such as wind, animals, or contaminated tools. \n\nFor management, I recommend continuing to manually remove the plants as best as you can, ensuring you get as much of the root as possible. You might also consider using a pre-emergent herbicide in early spring to prevent the seeds from germinating. Additionally, maintaining a thick layer of mulch can help suppress weed growth by blocking sunlight. \n\nIf the problem persists, you might want to consult with a local extension office or a professional horticulturist who can examine the plant in person.

This week, we noticed brown spots on leave tips (see photos) an unusual occurrence. Three weeks ago, Consumers Power started replacing gas lines to the city, and dug two holes in our sidewalk and one in our yard about six feet from the Yellowwood. The holes went down about six feet and were about 2.5 feet square. They were uncovered for a week, and have since been filled in with dirt.

        "decision": "<Respond>",
        "utterance": "Based on the information provided, the browning of the leaves on your Yellowwood tree could be attributed to several factors. The recent construction activity near the tree may have caused root disturbance or compaction, which can stress the tree and lead to leaf browning. Additionally, the variable weather conditions, including periods of dryness, could contribute to the symptoms you're observing. Since the browning is more pronounced on the southwest side and on new growth, it might also be related to sun exposure or wind damage.\n\nTo help your tree recover, I recommend the following steps:\n1. **Watering**: Ensure consistent watering, especially during dry spells. Deep watering once a week should be sufficient, focusing on the root zone.\n2. **Mulching**: Apply a layer of organic mulch around the base of the tree to help retain soil moisture and regulate temperature.\n3. **Monitoring**: Keep an eye on the tree for any changes or worsening of symptoms. If the browning continues or spreads, consider consulting a local arborist for a more detailed assessment.\n4. **Protection**: If possible, provide some wind protection to the southwest side of the tree to reduce stress from wind exposure.\n\nThese steps should help mitigate the stress factors affecting your tree. If you notice any other changes or have further questions, feel free to reach out.",

No other plants appear to have defoliation in the images. Wet soil can be seen but rather typical for this time of year. There also seems to be a slope to the garden in some places.  The reason for the defoliation is not clear. Root issues are possible but less likely due to topography and green stems. There is a new fungal leaf spot, stem lesion problem called boxwood blight where a dominate symptom is defoliation. This unlikely as it is rarely seen in the landscape and shown susceptible mainly under laboratory conditions.  The more likely problem is abiotic or non-living issue, especially since other reports of the same condition have been coming in. Wet cold weather is unlikely to be the issue since these plants normally can tolerate these conditions and generally flower nicely during the middle of the dormant season (the main reason to put these in\u00a0 our gardens). We have seen a similar defoliation event occur a few years ago when we had a major smoke event in the Willamette Valley.\u00a0Sarcococca spp. experienced significant green leaf drop over a few days after the smoke dissipated. These symptoms seen throughout the Willamette Valley where smoke was heavy but not in the Seattle area where smoke was not a problem. Plants in gardens and open-air structures were affected but not in a plastic hoop house. There was less species information but it appears S. confusa and S. ruscifolia were affected but the more common S. hookeriana var humilis were not. https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/pathogen-articles/nonpathogenic-phenomena/air-pollution-ozone But that was then and during the early fall. I suspect there may have been some air pollution event this past winter to cause these symptoms. An air inversion where wood smoke from heating fires gets caught in the area is one possibility. It would take more investigation of a broader area to figure this out.  Since the stems are still green we suspect the plants will leave out again.\nuser: Thank you, Drew,Is there any product that you recommend for the plants at this point?Sent from my iPhone On Apr 20, 2023, at 5:22 AM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\ufeff\n",

The sticky substance is likely honeydew, a byproduct of these pests. Given the proximity to rhododendrons with recurring scale issues, it's possible the infestation has spread. To treat this, you can start by spraying the trees with a strong jet of water to dislodge the pests. Follow up with an application of insecticidal soap or neem oil, ensuring thorough coverage of the leaves, especially the undersides. Monitor the trees regularly and reapply treatment as necessary. Additionally, consider introducing beneficial insects like ladybugs or lacewings, which are natural predators of these pests.

First, consider using barriers such as copper tape around your rhubarb plants, as snails are deterred by copper.

Additionally, setting up beer traps can be effective; snails are attracted to the yeast in beer and will drown in the liquid. Ensure to regularly check and empty these traps. If you prefer a more natural approach, introducing natural predators like birds or beneficial insects can help control the snail population.

        "dialog_context": "user: Hi!\r\nI have about 25 rose bushes in my back yard. They get plenty of sunlight and water. The leaves are green, but they don\u2019t produce any roses at all - they haven\u2019t for the last 2-3 years. Any idea what the cause and cure might be?\nexpert: There are a number of possibilities, and some might be overlapping. One of our primary suspects with roses is deer...do any deer visit the yard or browse nearby overnight?\u00a0They are very fond of roses, especially flower buds. If deer are a problem, a physical barrier (netting or a fence) or a chemical barrier (repellents that make the plant smell/taste bad to them) would be needed, though repellents are not always permanently effective.  Are the shrubs pruned back each winter\u00a0(around February or so)? If not, that might be one reason they don't look very vigorous or balanced in shape. Shrub (non-climbing) roses are best pruned back to around 15-18 inches off the ground, more or less, each winter or very early spring so that they are stimulated to produce vigorous regrowth that should flower better than older wood.  Even setting aside the flowering issue, these plants look weak, like they are not growing well. You mention they get plenty of sun, but are they getting a full 6-8 or more hours worth of unobstructed summer sun? If not, that can reduce plant vigor and suppress bloom.  You also mention plenty of water...are they only being watered on an as-needed basis, based on checking the soil (and recent weather), or are they on some sort of irrigation cycle that runs on a programmed timer?\u00a0If the latter, they may be getting over-watered, in which case root loss can result in branch dieback, sparser foliage, and poor/no bloom. Ideally, the soil near the roots should be checked about six inches deep and watered well only when it's becoming somewhat dry to the touch at that depth. Roses aren't very tolerant of constantly-damp soil, and extra watering will also leach certain nutrients out of the soil faster than watering only occasionally. While routine fertilization of roses should not normally be necessary in most soils, a laboratory soil test may reveal a deficiency in that planting area that might benefit from supplemental fertilizer. (We can help to interpret test results if you choose to send a sample to one of the labs on that page.)  The close-up of a blasted (dead) bud and dying stem could have been caused by an infection, but it's hard to tell from the photo. You can explore our rose diagnostic page to see if any of the ailments common to roses in our area seem to be affecting your plants. Some rose varieties are more vulnerable to certain diseases than others, though even resistant plants\u00a0are not perfectly immune. If/when fungicides are warranted, they need to be applied preventatively to protect still-healthy growth, since they are not able to cure any existing disease. Several repeat applications per year, each year, are usually needed when a rose is particularly vulnerable to a given disease (black spot, for example).\u00a0Weak or infected branches can be pruned off and discarded (don't compost).  Miri\nuser: Wow\u2026 Thanks for the quick & thorough response! \u00a0  Deer are definitely an issue \u2013 we get lots of them. It\u2019s odd that they seemed to leave them alone for several years, but now they seem to have added them to their diet. \u00a0  Also, I have not been cutting them back in the late winter. I\u2019m guessing it would not be good to cut them back now? \u00a0  I only water them when there is a long dry spell, but I\u2019m glad to know that I should not risk over-watering them. \u00a0  I might look into a soil test and the diagnostic page. \u00a0  Again, thanks for your help!! \u00a0  Best, Dan\nexpert: You're welcome!  Deer are probably the main factor in this case, then, though the other conditions we mentioned bear looking into, since more than one problem can still overlap and affect the plants. Deer can change habits as they become more over-crowded or desperate for food (they generally don't eat the invasive plants taking over local woodlands). Additionally,\u00a0perhaps there were excluded from another property or area that they used to be able to browse in. Many deer in residential neighborhoods actually stay there their entire lives, rather than coming and going from wooded areas further away, so their diet depends on what they can find in home yards and wild spaces in between. You can try periodically spraying the rose foliage with repellents...it might be enough, at least to teach the deer that this isn't a plant they will find appealing. The trouble is that repellents wear off over time and in rain, and sometimes deer are too hungry to care, or just get used to the smell/taste and eat the plants they want to eat anyway, so it's an uphill battle.  Miri\nuser: Thanks!! \u00a0 Would it make sense to cut the bushes back now, or wait til nest February?\u00a0  Best, Dan\n",

        "utterance": "It's generally best to wait until late winter, around February, to prune your rose bushes. Pruning at this time encourages vigorous growth and better flowering in the spring. Pruning now, outside of the optimal time, might not provide the same benefits and could potentially stress the plants if they are not in their dormant phase. However, if there are any dead or diseased branches, you can remove those at any time to maintain plant health.",

        "utterance": "Poa trivialis, commonly known as rough bluegrass, can be a challenging weed to manage in a bluegrass lawn. It tends to thrive in moist, shaded areas and can create unsightly patches. Acclaim Extra Selective Herbicide is primarily used for controlling grassy weeds like crabgrass and is not specifically labeled for poa trivialis. Unfortunately, there are limited selective herbicides available for poa trivialis that won't also harm your desirable bluegrass. \n\nOne approach is to improve cultural practices to make your lawn less hospitable to poa trivialis. This includes improving drainage, reducing shade, and avoiding overwatering. In some cases, spot treatment with non-selective herbicides like glyphosate may be necessary, followed by reseeding or resodding the affected areas with your desired grass type. \n\nIt's also worth consulting with a local extension service or a professional lawn care provider for specific recommendations tailored to your lawn's conditions. They may have more localized advice or newer products that could be effective. Remember to always follow label instructions and consider the impact on your lawn's health and the environment.",

He in Germantown, me in Silver Spring.  Is it worth the investment to have them moved?  Is it good for the tree?\nexpert: Hi, Reese the trees in the photos, we don't believe you will have much success trying to transplant them. They are fairly close together and most likely their roots are growing together, intertwined. They are also planted pretty close to the house and the fence so it's likely the roots go under neither the fence. It would be quite challenging the dig up their root masses to have a successful transplant. You can see more information on what would be required to transplant large trees and shrubs on your webpage.\u00a0 Also transplanting trees (even planting new trees) puts stress on the plant. There is a pest that has been creeping up into Maryland with warming temperatures called Crapemyrtle Bark Scale. Our entomology team\u00a0is still in the process of finding appropriate treatment for it. Trying to transplant these would more than likely introduce the scale when they are stressed and potentially cause more issues down the road. If you did want to attempt to move the trees, it would probably require a knowledgeable landscape professional. The cost for this may not be worth it. You could purchase new crapemyrtles and have them installed (and they would probably come with a warranty from your local garden center) for possibly for less or equivalent of the cost (depending on the size of the new trees).\u00a0Crapemyrtles tend to grow fairly quickly so if it is a plant that you would want to use for screening, planting new trees is probably the easiest route to take.\u00a0 Generally though, we recommend planting native trees for a number of reasons. Depending on the site qualities (space, sun/shade, deer presence etc) you could find another flowering tree that could provide screening and benefit native wildlife and hopefully not be as susceptible to disease and pests.\u00a0 If you have further questions about the transplanting or maybe choosing a different tree that could work for your screening purposes, feel free to attach a photo of that space and we can guide you to other options that could work for you.\u00a0 -Emily\nuser: Emily, I am so appreciative for your very thoughtful response.\u00a0 My son is trying to cull over grown areas in his garden and I am living in my home with a backyard whose views make us look like we are in a fish bowl... I thought the more mature the plant the better for my purpose.I have been researching native trees that will give me \"quick growth\" and wide boughs, and mature height is somewhere between 15 or 20 foot.\u00a0 Am I on the\u00a0right track?\u00a0 Bark interest is as important to me as the leaves.\u00a0 Hawthorne (winter king), Fringe tree, poplar tulip, Birch tree, Redbud, Service Berry, Yellow wood American, American\u00a0Hornbeam.

        "utterance": "Hi, Logan, you're definitely on the right track with your research into native trees that offer quick growth and interesting bark. Among the options you've listed, each has its own unique characteristics that could suit your needs. For instance, the Redbud and Serviceberry are both excellent choices for their beautiful spring blooms and manageable size. The Birch tree is known for its striking bark, which can add visual interest year-round. The American Hornbeam is another great option, known for its attractive bark and adaptability to different conditions. It's also worth considering the specific conditions of your backyard, such as soil type and sunlight, to ensure the best growth for your chosen trees. If you have any specific questions about these trees or need further guidance, feel free to ask. Best of luck with your planning! Warm regards, Emily",

Maybe fungus gnats?\nexpert: It's hard to tell for certain from the photos, but a common culprit for sudden plant collapse in summer is Southern Blight. The fungus prospers in warm weather and conditions where air circulation around the crown of a plant (the main growth points, where stems emerge from the soil) is limited due to factors like\u00a0dense growth and mulch crowding or covering\u00a0the crown. Other types of crown rot pathogens act similarly. Fungus gnats are not likely, especially in outdoor environments where they have predators and competing organisms to deal with.  Once collapsed, a plant will not recover and should be removed so it doesn't continue to harbor any pathogens that may spread further. Do not compost the debris. Replanting in that area should be fine\u00a0(the pathogens are ubiquitous so there is no way to keep them from coming back if conditions are ideal for them) as long as the plants are spaced sufficiently and not heavily mulched up to the crown so they continue to get good air circulation. No fungicide will provide any benefit.  While dense groundcover plantings have several benefits, like helping to out-compete weeds, reduce the need for mulch, and can be aesthetically appealing, unfortunately Southern\u00a0Blight and similar diseases are a risk that increases in those conditions. The plants in your photo are not overly dense right now, but we mention this as something to keep in mind for when they eventually fill in and more completely carpet that area. If outbreaks of blight continue to afflict replacement plants in that part of the garden, consider mixing-in other groundcover species that might have less vulnerability to those kinds of\u00a0pathogens.  To further reduce the risk of these types of\u00a0blights, make sure that plants are only watered when they need it, which is when the soil around four to six inches deep (four may suffice for shallower-rooted groundcovers like this)\u00a0has become somewhat dry to the touch at that depth.  Miri\nuser: Thank you for your help. If a fungus is the cause would spraying with an anti fungal like Captan help?

        "utterance": "Using an antifungal like Captan is unlikely to be effective in this situation. Southern Blight and similar fungal diseases are systemic and often not controlled by surface fungicides. The best approach is to remove affected plants promptly to prevent the spread of the pathogen. Ensure good air circulation around the plants and avoid mulching too close to the crown. Replanting with sufficient spacing and monitoring soil moisture can help prevent future outbreaks. Unfortunately, fungicides like Captan won't provide the protection needed against these types of blights.",

I recommend ensuring the plant is kept in a warm, stable environment and monitoring the soil pH.

        "utterance": "Based on your description and the environment you live in, it's quite possible that the tiny black/brown bugs are clover mites. These mites are known to invade homes, especially in the spring and fall, and can leave a red stain when crushed. To manage clover mites, you can seal cracks and gaps around windows and doors to prevent them from entering. Additionally, keeping vegetation trimmed back from the house can help reduce their numbers. If they are already inside, vacuuming them up is an effective way to remove them without causing stains. Avoid crushing them to prevent the red smears. If the problem persists, you might consider consulting a pest control professional for further assistance.",

The question is:\r\nDo I wait and finish this project in November or get a boom in and finish the job this week?  \r\nThank you!\nexpert: Hi, Harper, The open wounds created March 11th have sealed themselves and are no longer an entry point for oak wilt to infect the tree. If you choose to have the work completed now, you may use paint to immediately seal any wounds that are created, including the stump. Or, you may choose to wait until November, when the treat of oak wilt spreading overland is non-existent.\u00a0 My general rule of thumb is that if you can remove the oak tree in question without damaging neighboring oak trees, then you may do that anytime of year - just seal the stump to be sure.\u00a0 Feel free to reach out with any questions.

At the time, you had noticed our crepemyrtle in the photo we sent and advised us to be on the lookout for crepemyrtle bark scale - a new pest in Maryland.  Lately, we have noticed black on several branches of our crepemyrtle and a few dead branches that had a lot of black on them.  I am sending a photo of the tree and 2 closeups of branches.  Does this look like crepemyrtle bark scale or damage done by the spotted lantern fly which we have seen around?  Any help you can give us would be greatly appreciated as this tree is an important plant in our landscape.  Thank you!\nexpert: We're glad to hear the spruce has recovered nicely. For the crapemyrtle, the close-up photos of the branches show some lichen growth (natural and harmless) and what might be a mild amount of sooty mold darkening the bark. That fungus doesn't infect the plant, but if it's growing on honeydew, the source of that honeydew can be a range of sap-feeding insects. On crapemyrtle, the two insects primarily responsible for producing honeydew would be Crapemyrtle Bark Scale and Crapemyrtle Aphids. Since we don't see any scale in the photos, aphids or any Spotted Lanternfly in the area might be the cause here, if it is indeed sooty mold and not other harmless mold growth.  Although there was concern over the risk when this insect was more new to our area,\u00a0Spotted Lanternflies have since been observed to not\u00a0cause any significant\u00a0damage to home landscape plants, though their honeydew production\u00a0(when populations are high) can be a nuisance and offensively smelly when large amounts of it ferments, plus may support unappealing outbreaks of heavier sooty mold growth, since honeydew is mostly sugar-water.  If you think you see scale on the main trunk or branches, feel free to share more photos for feedback, but from what we can see, the tree looks good and no scale are visible.  Miri\nuser: Thank you for your reply, Miri. \u00a0I'm sending a photo of a few small white cottony\u00a0areas on the trunk. \u00a0 I have not seen any insects on the crepemyrtle just a few\u00a0dead branches covered in black and live branches with a bit of black on them. \u00a0The black is not something that I have seen on the crepemyrtle before. \u00a0The leaves look fine. \u00a0Maybe just keep a watch to see if more branches die? Thank you!\n",
        "decision": "<Respond>",
        "utterance": "Thank you for the additional photo. The small white cottony areas on the trunk could indeed be indicative of crepemyrtle bark scale, as they often appear as white, waxy, or cottony masses. The black areas on the branches are likely sooty mold, which grows on the honeydew excreted by sap-feeding insects like the bark scale. Since you haven't observed any insects, it's possible that the scale is in an early stage or that the population is low. I recommend monitoring the tree closely for any increase in the white cottony areas or any visible insects. You can also gently scrape off a small section of the white area to see if there are any live insects underneath. If you confirm the presence of bark scale, treatment options include horticultural oil or insecticidal soap, applied according to the product instructions. Pruning out the dead branches can also help improve the tree's appearance and health. Keep an eye on the tree and feel free to reach out if you notice any changes or have further questions.",

Since the condition has worsened recently and there is no irrigation, the disease might be exacerbated by environmental conditions. Here are some steps you can take to manage the situation:\n\n1. **Improve Drainage:** Ensure that your lawn has good drainage to prevent water from pooling, which can promote fungal growth.\n\n2. **Mow Properly:** Keep your grass at a height of about 3 inches to reduce stress on the lawn.\n\n3. **Fertilization:** Apply a balanced fertilizer to strengthen the grass and help it recover.\n\n4. **Fungicide Application:** Consider applying a fungicide specifically labeled for Summer Patch. Follow the instructions carefully for the best results.\n\n5. **Monitor and Adjust:** Keep an eye on the affected areas and adjust your lawn care practices as needed.\n\nIf the problem persists, it might be beneficial to have a sample analyzed in a lab for a more precise diagnosis.

        "utterance": "Sue, thank you for providing detailed information about your Cape Fuchsia. Based on the symptoms you've described, the spots on the leaves could be due to a fungal infection, which is common in plants with dense foliage and high humidity. Since the plant is in clay soil, which retains moisture, this could contribute to the problem. Here are a few steps you can take:\n\n1. **Improve Air Circulation**: Ensure that the plant is not overcrowded and has good air circulation around it. This can help reduce humidity and prevent fungal growth.\n\n2. **Watering Practices**: Water the plant at the base rather than overhead to keep the foliage dry. Ensure that the soil is not waterlogged, as excess moisture can promote fungal diseases.\n\n3. **Fungicide Treatment**: Consider using a fungicide labeled for use on ornamental plants. Follow the instructions carefully for application.\n\n4. **Pruning**: Remove and dispose of any affected leaves to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nIf the problem persists, you might want to consult with a local extension service or a professional for further diagnosis.

Regularly inspect your property for early signs of nest building, especially in spring and early summer.\n2. Seal any cracks or openings in your home's exterior to prevent wasps from entering and establishing nests.\n3. Consider using wasp deterrents or traps around your property, particularly in areas where nests have been found before.\n4. Keep food sources, such as garbage bins, tightly sealed to avoid attracting wasps.\n\nRegarding your concern about them burrowing into your house, yellowjackets typically do not burrow into homes from their nests.

One thought is potential ozone damage, due to poor air quality (and we've had several alerts the last month) and some think it could be a disease like anthracnose. With the cool, wet weather we've had, anthracnose could be a likely culprit.  In both cases, there is nothing you can do at this time, except keep the tree well watered, as stress-free as possible, and practice good cultural practices. If it is a disease, it's not going to harm the overall health of the tree.\u00a0  There could also be some natural shedding of leaves because it's likely the tree produced a ton of extra leaves in the spring and is now shedding some because of the hot weather.\nuser: Front yard tree looks worst ever. \u00a0All leafs are brown. \u00a0Leafs dropping every week. new pictures attached 8/17/23 By what you see is this tree dead?\n",

It's possible that the timing of the application coincided with a sensitive growth phase of the Hibiscus, making it more susceptible to damage. Even if other plants are not showing symptoms, different species have varying levels of tolerance to herbicides. To help your Hibiscus recover, ensure it is well-watered, as this can help it flush out any absorbed chemicals.

These evergreens are fairly adaptable and tolerant of a variety of conditions but are sensitive to their roots\u00a0staying too wet, too dry (from\u00a0prolonged drought without watering), and to salt residues building-up in the soil. (\"Salt\"\u00a0in this case can mean ice-melt products applied to a nearby sidewalk or driveway,\u00a0or even fertilizers that are over-applied.)  Although Yews tolerate heavy and regular pruning/shearing well, they and other dense-leaved shrubs can be over-pruned if this results in poor regrowth or such crowded foliage that it allows for pest or disease outbreaks. In this case we don't suspect a pest issue, though you can check the needle undersides for Cottony Camellia Scale insects (as pictured in the linked page) in case they are exacerbating another problem. Few diseases infect Yews but root rot from soil that drains poorly or which stays too wet is a possibility. We don't see the drastic branch yellowing/browning and\u00a0dieback that tends to occur with root rot, but it's something to consider remedying if you have a roof downspout outlet nearby or a leaky hose spigot adding water to its root zone before it contributes to long-term damage. Otherwise, perhaps that section of branches that are late in leafing-out compared to the rest of the plant\u00a0was merely pruned too heavily, especially if the pruning was done in autumn (early spring is better). While Yews are capable of regenerating growth on older branch wood after pruning, removing too much young wood on the branch ends instead of just lightly clipping their tips\u00a0can cause regrowth to be much slower.  Unless scale insects are present and abundant, nothing needs to be done treatment-wise as the plant likely just needs time to finish leafing-out in that area. Or, there is already an infection or another cause of dieback at work near the base of the main branches whose tips are those with delayed new growth\u00a0and no intervention will reverse it. You'll just have to monitor the plant and see if this worsens into browning or shedding needles, in which case the declining branches would need to be trimmed out. For now, the plant looks to be in decent shape and we think it will recover in time (Yew growth is generally slow) since the new growth emerging in those currently more-bare areas appears normal.\u00a0Feel free to share other photos if you see symptoms you think are new or worsening, or if you see what you suspect are scale but aren't sure. To monitor the plant's water needs, feel the soil six inches deep next to the root zone and water well only if it's becoming somewhat dry to the touch at that depth. (If damp when tested, the plant should have enough water.)  Miri\nuser: Hello- Very helpful information.\u00a0 Thank you!\u00a0 This shrub gets lots of sun in the afternoon and is watered only when it rains.\u00a0 (The house belongs to my elderly aunt.) So it may be too dry.\u00a0 She also has a lawn service who is probably over-fertilizing it because they start in January and arrive every month fertilizing and/or killing weeds.\u00a0 Additionally, I will check the underside of the leaves for insects.

        "utterance": "To manage the regrowth of your big leaf maple trees and maintain their aesthetic value, you can selectively prune the trees to encourage healthier growth. Since the trees are coming back in clumps with multiple trunks, it is advisable to thin them out by selecting one or two of the strongest trunks to keep and removing the others. This will help the trees develop a stronger structure and improve their overall health. Pruning should ideally be done during the dormant season, which is late fall to winter, to minimize stress on the trees. As for resources, you might find 'The Pruning Book' by Lee Reich helpful, as it covers a wide range of pruning techniques. Additionally, contacting your local extension service can provide you with region-specific advice and resources. Enjoy the beautiful fall colors of your maples!",

Dollar spot thrives in conditions of high humidity and can spread rapidly if not treated. Applying a fungicide specifically labeled for dollar spot can help manage the disease. Be sure to follow the instructions on the fungicide label for the best results. Additionally, aerating your lawn can improve air circulation and reduce compaction, which can help prevent fungal diseases. While aeration is typically done in the fall, if your lawn is severely compacted, you might consider doing it sooner.

The chewed leaves might indicate caterpillars or beetles, but since you haven't seen many bugs, aphids are a more likely culprit. To address this, you can use insecticidal soap, which is effective against soft-bodied insects like aphids. When choosing an insecticidal soap, look for products that are labeled as safe for beneficial insects. These typically contain potassium salts of fatty acids and are less likely to harm beneficial insects when used as directed. Be sure to apply the soap in the early morning or late evening to minimize impact on pollinators and beneficial insects that are active during the day.",

This typically shouldn't harm the tree and leaves should continue to leaf out. I would wait and monitor the tree over the next couple of weeks to see if the leaf drop stops, as the hot/dry weather should control the fungal disease on its own. With anthracnose on ash, you'll typically see some brown or tan lesions on the leaves and maybe some curling. If you take a closer look at the leaves that fell, do you see anything like that on the leaves?

        "utterance": "Hi, Elliot, given the additional information, it seems like your tree is experiencing significant stress. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. **Tree Survival**: Trees can survive significant leaf loss, but it does put stress on them. Monitor the tree for new leaf growth, which is a good sign of recovery.\n\n2. **Watering**: Ensure the tree is adequately watered, especially during dry spells. Deep watering once a week should suffice, ensuring the soil is moist but not waterlogged.\n\n3. **Fertilization**: Avoid over-fertilizing, as this can stress the tree further. If the lawn food is high in nitrogen, it might not be ideal for the tree. Consider using a balanced tree fertilizer or stakes specifically designed for trees, but do so cautiously.\n\n4. **Ash Borer**: The symptoms you describe do not immediately suggest an ash borer infestation, which typically includes D-shaped exit holes in the bark and canopy dieback. However, it is wise to inspect the tree for these signs or consult a professional arborist for a thorough examination.\n\n5. **General Care**: Continue to monitor the tree closely. If the leaf drop continues or you notice other symptoms, consulting with a local arborist or extension service might be beneficial for a more detailed assessment.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish your tree a speedy recovery.

First, using the same containers and partially old soil can sometimes lead to disease build-up, which might affect plant health. It's a good practice to clean containers with a mild bleach solution (1 part bleach to 9 parts water) before reusing them to prevent disease. The colder weather could indeed stress the plants, but if the plants you purchased were already infected or stressed, that could also be a factor. Overhead watering can sometimes promote fungal diseases, especially in cooler, damp conditions. Consider watering at the base of the plants to minimize leaf wetness. If the stems are darkened, it might indicate a fungal infection, which can be treated with a fungicide.

        "utterance": "Based on the information provided, it is generally recommended to remove infected branches as soon as possible to prevent the spread of Dutch Elm disease, especially if the infection is at least 5 feet from the trunk. However, the timing of the removal is crucial. Removing branches during the active beetle season (spring and summer) can potentially attract more beetles, which spread the disease. Therefore, if the infection is severe and poses a risk to the tree's structural integrity, it might be necessary to remove the branch immediately. Otherwise, waiting until the beetle is dormant in the fall (October/November) might be safer to minimize the risk of further infection. Consulting with an ISA-Certified arborist, as you plan to do, is a wise decision to get a professional assessment of the tree's condition and the best course of action.",

I noticed after a month or so that it wasn't straight, so staked, tying it off with wire protected by garden hose. I staked it too rigidly and with not enough ability to sway and strengthen. I staked it with two stakes on the same.plane about 18 inches out from the tree. When I removed the the stakes, it flopped over. This was about 5 weeks ago. I have driven a new stake in the ground perpendicular to the prevailing winds (north, but they also come from the west where the stake is). I have not actuually tied the tree to the stake because I am afraid of weakening it again. Is it too late to assist this tree in growing straighter? Do I need to start I wr. I don't expect it to be perfectly straight - trees aren't necessarily straight in nature, but this one is too bent and I don't know how it will look as it matures. It is in a prominent place in my yard, almost a specimen. Will it always be weak because it was staked too rigidly when it was young?

        "decision": "<Respond>",
        "utterance": "It's not too late to assist your cascara tree in growing straighter. Since you've already driven a new stake perpendicular to the prevailing winds, you can proceed with tying the tree to this stake. Use a flexible tie material, such as a tree tie or a soft cloth, to allow some movement and prevent girdling. It's important to allow the tree to sway slightly, as this encourages the development of a stronger trunk. \n\nFor staking, you can use two stakes placed opposite each other to provide balanced support. Tying the tree at two points along the trunk is a good approach. Place one tie about 1/3 of the way up from the base and the other no more than 2/3 of the way up. This will provide stability while still allowing the tree to move and strengthen. \n\nMonitor the tree's growth and adjust the ties as needed to prevent any damage to the bark. If the tree shows signs of improvement and begins to grow straighter, you can gradually reduce the support over time. If the tree does not improve or if it remains too bent, you might consider replacing it in the fall. However, given that cascara trees are fast-growing, your current tree still has a good chance to recover and mature into a healthy specimen.",

Dutch Elm disease typically causes more extensive internal damage, so it's possible that the tree is experiencing another issue, such as a localized infection or injury. If the tree is important to you, I recommend consulting with a local arborist who can perform a more thorough examination and possibly test for Dutch Elm disease. If the infection is confirmed and the damage is extensive, removal might be the best option to prevent the spread to other trees.

Any advice or recommendations would be appreciated.\nexpert: Hi, Dakota, It is hard to say from the photos, so I have some questions. It can be risky to plant broadleaf evergreens such as cherry laurel in the fall. That does not give them much time to develop a substantial root system to support themselves. Broadleaf evergreens continue to lose moisture through the stomata (pores) in their leaves, especially on very sunny or windy days, but cannot take up additional moisture from frozen soil. I suspect the frigid weather most of PA experienced right before Christmas is partly to blame. My question is mostly about the soil where they are planted - does it drain well, or is it heavy clay that holds a lot of water? Cherry laurels require good drainage. Also, I can't tell from the images if they may have been planted a little too deeply - they should have been planted at the same depth as they were growing in their pots or rootball (if B&B). Best regards, Sandy\nuser: I may be guilty of putting them a little too deep. Regarding the soil, I know there is some heavy clay deep. But I did dig a hole larger than the root ball and placed a lot of good soil around it. What would your recommendations be to save them? Or is it too late?\n",
        "decision": "<Respond>",
        "utterance": "Given the situation, there are a few steps you can take to help your cherry laurels recover. First, consider gently lifting the plants to ensure they are not planted too deeply. The top of the root ball should be level with or slightly above the surrounding soil. This can help prevent root rot and improve drainage. Additionally, ensure that the soil around the plants is not compacted and allows for good drainage. You might also want to add organic matter or compost to improve soil structure and drainage. Water the plants deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth, and consider applying a layer of mulch to help retain moisture and regulate soil temperature. Lastly, monitor the plants for any signs of pests or diseases, and prune any dead or damaged branches to encourage new growth. With these steps, there's a good chance your cherry laurels can recover.",

In your case, they are probably caused by gall wasps. These insects lay their eggs on the leaves, and the plant tissue grows around the eggs, forming the galls. Generally, galls are not harmful to the overall health of the tree, especially if the tree is otherwise healthy, as you mentioned. They are more of a cosmetic issue. If you wish to manage them, it's important to note that once galls have formed, there is little that can be done to remove them. Preventative measures include promoting tree health and possibly using insecticidal treatments early in the season before the galls form, but these are often not necessary unless the infestation is severe.

The scarring or injury on the entire cucumber could be due to environmental factors or a specific pest or disease that targets this variety. Since oedema was ruled out, consider checking for signs of cucumber beetles or other pests that might cause scarring. Additionally, environmental stressors such as inconsistent watering or extreme temperatures could also lead to such symptoms. It might be helpful to monitor the growing conditions closely and ensure that the plants are not under stress. If the problem persists, consider consulting a local extension service for a more detailed analysis.",

I can only find this one specimen but obviously there could be more.  Please see attached photos.  INaturalist identified the plant as being in the genus Eryngium.  When googling Eryngium it came up as Erynguim and showed many different plants.  The plant closest to the one in the wetlands is Eryngium horridum but it is from southern South America.  Would you please identify it and let me know if it is native to Ohio wetlands?  What should I do if it is not native?\nexpert: Greetings Deirdra,  I don't have the confidence to positively identify these photos to species in the absence of flowers or a specimen in hand.

However, my initial thought is that this may be Eryngium yuccifolium (or button eryngo), a species native to Ohio.

        "utterance": "Hi, Peyton, it sounds like you have a solid plan in place. Using Tenacity as a pre-emergent and post-emergent herbicide is a good choice for controlling Poa annua. Applying it before seeding and then again at the 3-leaf stage with Poa Constrictor should help manage any new Poa growth. As for mulching, using the topsoil company's mulch to top dress the seed is a practical and cost-effective option for moisture retention and bird control. Just ensure that the mulch layer is not too thick, as it might hinder seed germination. Good luck with your lawn renovation!",

I am on a fungicide program and was told fungus us not active.\nexpert: Is your lawn type cool-season (fescue, ryegrass, or bluegrass) or warm-season (zoysia)? Both are growing right now, so it's hard to tell from the photo alone, though cool-season grasses are slowing and going summer-dormant soon, during which time a moderate amount of browning is normal and unavoidable.  When to fertilize will depend on the grass type, as nutrient supplementation might improve grass color a bit. What formulation to use, and in what dosage,\u00a0will also depend\u00a0on the results of your most recent laboratory soil test, in order to comply with Maryland lawn fertilizer restrictions. If nitrogen, iron, manganese, or magnesium were deficient, for example, a boost in\u00a0any of those nutrients can green-up a lawn. Nitrogen is not part of a standard soil test, since such measurements would not be very reliable, but it's a component in all lawn fertilizers anyway.  Yellowing and browning can also occur with a range of commonplace turfgrass diseases. Even if not actively spreading or worsening now, several fungal pathogens can cause damage to grass blades, making a lawn overall look less green. Many of these do not require fungicide intervention (which can't cure existing infections anyway, just suppress new ones), and the grass will grow out of the damage in due time. (For example, cool-season grasses, when they resume more active growth in autumn, will look better on their own, compared to their normal stagnation in growth for summer.) You can explore our Lawn Diseases information if you want to see if symptoms match certain conditions; close examination of leaf lesions might be needed to tell one infection apart from another.  Drought stress can also shut down growth and cause some grass blades to shrivel and turn yellow or brown. While occasional watering helps reduce heat stress on cool-season grasses, and supports good zoysia growth, over-watering will encourage infection spread and will not necessarily keep cool-season grasses in active growth all summer. Our mid-Atlantic conditions make it challenging to have a lawn thrive all year long with no interruptions in growth or a lush\u00a0appearance.  Miri\nuser: Thank you for the reply. It is tall type turf fescue.   On Thu, Jun 20, 2024, 1:24 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nexpert: Okay, then the turf may be starting to go dormant for the summer, given our recent heat and dry conditions. If a fungicide regimen is already being used, then no other intervention for fungal diseases should be needed at this point. Keep an eye on watering needs so the browning doesn't become too extensive (the turf roots should stay alive, even if drought kills some foliage), and any minor fungal outbreaks should resolve themselves and you can fertilize as normal later this autumn.  Miri\nuser: FYI, it seems to get lighter/yellow with watering. I am deeply frustrated st this point. Thank you for your time. I really appreciate it!

Live with it. 2. Spray it with a non-selective herbicide, like glyphosate, then re-seed or re-sod the area with your desired species. 3.\u00a0 Dig it out, and then re-seed or re-sod. I hope this is helpful! Cordially, John\nuser: Good morning John, thanks for the prompt reply!I\u2019m going to use mechanical approach as primary with limited chemical controls.

        "utterance": "Hi, Jordan, glyphosate is indeed available over the counter at most garden centers and home improvement stores. Fall is an excellent time for reseeding your lawn, as the cooler temperatures and increased rainfall create ideal conditions for grass seed germination. As for the grass seed mix, it depends on your location and the conditions of your lawn (such as sun exposure and soil type). However, a common recommendation for a durable and lush lawn is a mix of Kentucky bluegrass, perennial ryegrass, and fine fescue. This combination provides a good balance of resilience, texture, and color. Make sure to follow the instructions on the seed package for the best results. Good luck with your lawn renovation this weekend!",

        "utterance": "Based on the symptoms and conditions you've described, it does seem like your pine trees are suffering from white pine blister rust, exacerbated by the wet soil conditions. Unfortunately, as you noted, there are no effective fungicides for treating this disease once it has taken hold. Trimming the affected branches is a good step to help manage the spread. For the wet soil conditions, improving drainage around the trees can help reduce stress. You might consider creating raised beds or installing drainage tiles to divert excess water away from the root zones. Additionally, applying a balanced slow-release fertilizer in the spring can help strengthen the trees' overall health, making them more resilient to stress and disease. Your decision to plant thuja green giants is a good one, as they are generally more tolerant of wet conditions.

They're about 5-7 years old, and last year I transplanted them from pots into my yard.  This year, as I was cleaning away the grass from around their trunk, I noticed an accumulation of what looks very much like raspberry jam in the soil abutting the trunk.  I suspect it's related to a fungus or insect attacking the tree, but I'm not sure what does that.  \r\n\r\nAny ideas on what it might be or how to combat it would be well appreciated.\nexpert: Hi, Peyton looks like gummosis likely due to a boring insect. Stone fruit trees are susceptible to borers and since you started these trees from grocery store fruit, it would be difficult to determine what they're parent plants may be. Especially with fruit trees and their many different cultivars that have been bread for disease resistance, growth habit, heat tolerance etc, growing from the pit they will be unlikely to fruit. Usually plant breeders and fruit tree\u00a0growers will graft fruit trees so they know what root stock and top growth they are getting. Growing from the pit is a fun experiment but could be why they are getting borers as the trees may be stressed from being 'not true to form' plants.\u00a0 You can read more about peach tree borers on our webpage and ways to manage them:\u00a0https://extension.umd.edu/resource/peach-cherry-plum-and-nectarine-insect-pests Let us know if you have further questions.\u00a0 Emily\nuser: Thank you, Emerson. \u00a0That's great information. \u00a0I'll take a look at the linked content. \u00a0I appreciate your time with this.

Wet weather could be contributing\u00a0plants can drop leaves from overwatering so your thought on 'wet feet' is a reasonable one.\u00a0\u00a0In looking at the location of your tree it doesn't seem like that area would be too wet.\u00a0 Clay does drain less well than other soils, but crabapples can thrive here in the Champlain Valley where I live and the clay is deep! The wet weather, however, can contribute to diseases especially those caused by\u00a0fungi.\u00a0 A common one is 'Apple Scab' that can cause leaf blotching and subsequent dropping of infected leaves.\u00a0 Here is how the condition is described: Leaf spots are round, olive-green, and up to 1/2\" across Spots are velvet-like with fringed borders As they age, spots turn dark brown and get bigger/grow together\u00a0 Spots often form along the leaf veins Leaves with many spots turn yellow and drop by mid-summer  The condition can also impact the fruit - they show similar spots and if infected early can become deformed and cracked. Spores can be carried by the wind (and likely built up with our very wet summer last year) but you should rake up the leaves and fruit and remove from the area (burn or compost)\u00a0to decrease the risk of infection next year.\u00a0 On a mature tree the condition usually doesn't kill the tree and doing nothing is often recommended,\u00a0but on your young tree there is reason for concern.\u00a0 You might want to consider fertilizing the tree and if the weather gets dry, you want to be sure to provide adequate water\u00a0(trees need extra watering for at least\u00a02 years after planting). In the future you can look into scab-resistant cultivars of crabapples. I'm attaching a photo here for you to compare to your leaves.\u00a0 If it doesn't look like this is the problem with your crabapple, please do send a photo or two and I'll look into what else might be causing this problem. By the way, it looks like this will be a lovely garden as all the plantings mature!\nexpert: Barbara, I've asked the program folks if you can drop the leaves off and waiting for a reply.\u00a0 I also sent a photo of apple scab that you compare your leaves to. Best, Andrea\nexpert: Hello, Charlie:  We had the UVM Plant Pathologist take a look at your submission, and following is the info. she provided:  To me, the plant looks overall chlorotic which I suspect is an issue in the root system. It may be just trying to get established but there may also be root rot in there making things worse from all the wet weather.   Apple do not like wet feet. There is not much you can do this late in the season. If it was earlier I would recommend fertilizer, but it is getting too close to fall to give it much Nitrogen now. I think you have to just cross your fingers at this point and see how it comes out next spring. I would give it some 10-10-10 or ProGro 5-4-3 in May and hopefully it will recover.   I hope this information is helpful and wish you luck that the tree looks better next season.\nuser: Thanks very much for your information.

        "utterance": "Improving soil drainage around your crabapple tree without digging it up is possible. One method is to use a technique called vertical mulching. You can drill holes around the tree, about 12-18 inches deep and 2-3 inches wide, spaced about 2-3 feet apart. Fill these holes with a mixture of coarse sand, compost, and fine gravel. This can help improve aeration and drainage in the root zone. Be careful not to damage the roots while drilling. Additionally, consider creating a slight slope or using a French drain to redirect excess water away from the tree. These methods can help alleviate the waterlogging issue and improve the tree's health over time.",

Thanks for using our forum.\nuser: This was planted as a young tree by the builders in a new development 5 years ago and they told us it was a hackberry but that's all the information I have on it.

I suspect that the \u201cwarts\u201d you observed both last year and this year are attributable to mites known as hackberry Psyllids (Pachypsylla celtidismamma). They will not harm your hackberry and they can simply be ignored. More specifically these \u201cwarts\u201d are called leaf galls. They have mite larvae within them. The adults of these insects are extremely small and hard to detect. See the following for images of the galls and the adults: https://bugguide.net/node/view/229821 https://bugguide.net/node/view/229829 Here\u2019s the deal.\u00a0 In spring 2023, adults of these insects emerged from places where they had overwintered during 2022-23. This could have been under pieces of bark or some other nook or cranny of the hackberry. These adults mated and females laid eggs on the leaves of your tree. Larvae quickly hatched. These larvae burrowed into the leaf tissue. The leaves responded by enclosing the larvae with a form of a leaf cancerous growth that is a type of defensive response. This led to the appearance of the bumps and nodules (galls) that you saw in 2023. These larvae developed into adults in late summer 2023. The adults went into hibernation for the winter 2023-24. When they emerged early this 2024 season, the process started all over again. See: https://extension.illinois.edu/blogs/garden-scoop/2019-07-25-hackberry-gall https://lancaster.unl.edu/pest/resources/hackberrypsyllids.shtml Going back to the shape of the hackberry, how long have you been noticing this shape?

Boxwoods can be vulnerable to several stressors\u00a0(refer to the linked page),\u00a0but not every variety has equal susceptibility to each issue. If this planting bed is in full summer sun, the heat buildup from the wall not far behind the plants might be a contributing factor, especially if they had not yet been watered up to this point during this year (and last year's) droughts. If you replant, monitor the new plants\u00a0closely for watering needs, though boxwood can get stressed by a full sun location (despite how often they are grown in such sites) and another species might be better-suited to that location if it tends to get hot and dry in summer.

As a quick note, we also received your Extension Contact Form submission from the state office, we will continue to address this problem here if that works for you. The brown spots may be eggs of some kind, but do not appear to have the features of adult arthropods.\u00a0 Mites are known to take advantage of leaf hairs for shelter, so this remains a possibility.\u00a0 Mite populations can also be exacerbated by certain insecticide treatments. It is tough to say from the photo--it is still possible that they are a natural leaf feature or innocuous.\u00a0\u00a0 It is definitely not sawflies; these would be causing defoliation of the tree rather than yellowing, and you would see the crowds of caterpillar-like insects perpetrating the deed.\u00a0\u00a0 The lawn in your photo looks a bit dry, it's possible that the tree is experiencing drought stress now that things are heating up; this could be leading to symptoms that otherwise wouldn't be noticeable.\u00a0 Consider checking the soil around the tree to make sure your watering times are adequate and that the soil is amply moist.\u00a0 The yellowing may also be the result of a nutrient deficiency. It would be helpful if you were able to bring or send samples to the Extension office of a few leaves,\u00a0both affected and unaffected.\u00a0\u00a0 In the mean time, make sure that the tree is adequately watered, since a drought-stressed tree is more likely to be susceptible to other issues.\u00a0 Consider also spraying the foliage with water, particularly in the hottest parts of the day.\u00a0 This will both cool the tree and will help to discourage mite activity, if spider mites are active.\u00a0 Spider mites do not appreciate humidity, but thrive when conditions are hot and dry.

This is a common issue caused by a soil-borne bacterium called Streptomyces scabies. The dark areas could be related to bruising or another condition, but since the flesh inside is clear, it is likely not a serious issue. Potatoes with scab are generally safe to eat after peeling, as the scab is only skin deep. To prevent potato scab in the future, consider the following strategies: \n\n1. Rotate your crops: Avoid planting potatoes in the same soil where scab has been a problem for at least three years.\n2. Maintain soil pH: Scab thrives in alkaline conditions, so aim to keep your soil pH slightly acidic, around 5.0 to 5.2.\n3. Use certified seed potatoes: Start with disease-free seed potatoes to reduce the risk of introducing scab.\n4. Water management: Ensure consistent moisture levels during tuber formation, as dry conditions can exacerbate scab.\n\nBy implementing these practices, you can reduce the likelihood of scab affecting your future potato crops.",

This is harder than it sounds. I will explain why below.\u00a0 Apples: Without some type of documentation from the purchaser of the fruit trees, it is very difficult to identify a specific fruit cultivar, especially for apples because there are so many types. Sometimes you can narrow down the possibilities to a short-list of potential cultivars based on the color, texture, appearance, time of ripening, age, and size of the tree and then use an on-line apple data base. Other suggestions:\u00a0bring apple samples to an orchard-based Apple Day event. The most specific way is to use a genetic testing service that uses DNA fingerprinting to identify specific cultivars, but this may be more than you are interested in. See the following reference https://yardandgarden.extension.iastate.edu/faq/how-can-i-identify-apple-tree-variety-my-backyardPeaches: Reliance and Contender are two peach varieties that do well in VT. You probably have one of these cultivars. Once the peaches are ripe, you can compare photos and determine which you are likely to have.  Pears: Again many cultivars. Knowing the possibilities for your planting region could help. Do you know what Plant Hardiness Zone you are in-\u00a0 Zone 4 or 5? You can check on this map https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov You may be able to call around to find a fruit tree nursery that would be willing to look at your photos and fruit samples to help with ID.  I will also reach out to my collaborators to see if they are aware of anyone who helps with fruit identification at UVM. I will reach back out if I have further info and feel free to write again if you have more questions.\nuser: Hi, Jordan you for your answers. I suspected as much, so it will be a wait and see game.

        "utterance": "To increase the acidity of your soil for blueberry plants, you can use several methods. One common approach is to add elemental sulfur to the soil, which gradually lowers the pH over time. The amount needed will depend on your current soil pH and the desired pH level, typically between 4.5 and 5.5 for blueberries. It's best to apply sulfur in the fall to allow time for it to take effect by the next growing season. Alternatively, you can use acidifying fertilizers, such as ammonium sulfate, which can help lower pH while providing nutrients. Additionally, incorporating organic matter like peat moss can also help acidify the soil. Be sure to retest your soil pH periodically to monitor changes and adjust your approach as needed.",

        "utterance": "To stabilize your fir tree, it's important to address both the soil condition and the tree's anchoring. Given the saturated clay soil, improving drainage is crucial. You can carefully incorporate sand or gravel around the base to enhance drainage, but avoid disturbing the roots too much. Organic material can help improve soil structure over time, but it may not provide immediate stability. Additionally, consider using multiple stakes to provide more support, ensuring they are placed at an angle away from the tree and secured with flexible ties to allow some movement. Monitor the tree's stability and adjust the supports as needed, especially after heavy rains. Over time, as the soil condition improves and the tree re-establishes its roots, it should become more stable.",

        "utterance": "In St. Louis Park, MN, early October is generally considered late for overseeding cool-season grasses, as the ideal time is late summer to early fall. However, if you choose to proceed, you can still try overseeding, especially if the weather remains mild. Use a shade-tolerant grass seed mix due to the heavy shade in your yard. For topsoil, a thin layer of compost or topsoil can help cover the seeds and improve soil quality. As for fertilization, a starter fertilizer can be beneficial when overseeding. Regarding your new sprinkler system, water the newly seeded areas lightly and frequently, about 2-3 times a day for 5-10 minutes each time, to keep the soil consistently moist until the seeds germinate. Once the grass is established, you can reduce the frequency and increase the duration of watering sessions. Keep an eye on the weather, as cooler temperatures and frost can impact seed germination and growth.",

I don't yet have a definitive answer for your ground cherry problem and wanted to let you know that your question will be answered. It could be verticillium wilt, though you don't say whether or not the leaves droop later in the day. Ground cherries are part of the potato/tomato family and thus are susceptible to similar issues. I will continue to research this and get back to you. Lesley DC Master Gardeners\nexpert: Hello, Elliot, I'm thinking that there could be some sort of sucking insect, particularly on the underside of the leaves. If you shake the leaves do you see white flies/bugs? If so, you could simply squish them! Or spray with a strong jet of water. Or use Neem oil. It could also be clusters of mealybugs which will also respond to either squishing or Neem oil. Or even spidermites. All will respond to Neem Oil. For more details about mealybugs, click here.

Make sure the netting is secure and covers the plant adequately to prevent the squirrels from getting through. As for why this particular wisteria is affected and not the others, it could be due to its specific location on the trellis, making it more accessible or appealing to the squirrels. Additionally, different varieties might have varying levels of attractiveness or resistance to pests. Keep an eye on the plant after applying the netting to see if the situation improves.

The good news is that hydrangeas are quite resilient and can often recover with proper care. Here are a few steps you can take to help them rebound:\n\n1. **Soil Testing**: Consider testing your soil to check for nutrient imbalances. This will help you understand if there are any deficiencies or excesses that need to be addressed.\n\n2. **Watering**: Continue to water them deeply but less frequently to encourage deep root growth. Ensure the soil is well-drained to prevent root rot.\n\n3. **Mulching**: You've already added wood chips, which is great for retaining moisture and regulating soil temperature. Ensure the mulch is not too close to the stems to prevent rot.\n\n4. **Pruning**: Avoid heavy pruning this year. Incrediball hydrangeas bloom on new wood, so light pruning in late winter or early spring can encourage new growth and blooms.\n\n5. **Fertilization**: Next year, use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer formulated for hydrangeas or one with lower phosphorus content.\n\nWith these steps, your hydrangeas should have a good chance of recovering and blooming next year.

Later this spring I used a spade to loosen the soil and at the same time my neighbor laid down new mulch (her yard is mainly mulch with a few plantings).  All of a sudden we had dozens of digger bees.  I think the digger bees came from her mulch.  I looked at your extension website and they said not to harm the digger bees.  The digger bees chewed the roots of almost all my primroses as there was nothing blooming at that time and the primroses all died.  When I was trying to prune away the spent flowers the primroses all came away in my hands.  Per online non-chemical methods to get rid of them was sprinkling cinnamon, using peppermint oil, and finally laying down a heavy layer of mulch but none of them were of any use.  The digger bees dug holes in the soil and created a \u00bc inch muddy hold on the surface.  Finally I had to resort to use of chemicals but of course by that time all my primroses were gone \uf04c.  The bees didn\u2019t stay in my neighbor\u2019s yard and they all migrated to my yard.

The digger bees are now gone but I don\u2019t relish their appearance next year.  Any ideas for what I can do to prevent them coming back.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nZeba\nexpert: Hello, Emerson,  Ground-nesting bees, which comprise the vast majority of our native solitary bee species, were not responsible for the demise of the Primrose, nor did they arrive via the mulch since they cannot use mulch for nesting. It would be hard to diagnose the cause of damage for the\u00a0plants after they'd already died and without pictures of their symptoms, but root or crown\u00a0rot, drought stress, vole feeding damage, or a chewing insect pest (perhaps beetle grubs)\u00a0are more likely. The timing of the two occurrences is either coincidence or otherwise unrelated to the bees themselves, even if something was wrong with the mulch or soil in that area.  Home remedies are not reliable for insect repellency or treatment and are discouraged because they may cause other environmental harm. The bees were likely taking advantage of loosened soil for nesting since they have a harder time digging burrows in very compacted soil or in soil covered with a barrier like mulch. (Mulch would help prevent the formation of a burrow, but if the burrow was already there and then covered with mulch, the bees will reopen the nest\u00a0entrance if they can.)\u00a0If the bees appeared suddenly, it's possible a group of juveniles was already present in the soil from the year prior and had just matured and emerged, flying around to find mates before starting their own burrows. Male bees die soon after mating as they do not participate in burrow construction or providing for the young.  It is correct that solitary bees\u00a0are highly valued pollinators and should not be eradicated if at all possible since they have little suitable habitat left in natural areas. Once females have started forming burrows to provision with pollen for their young, it may be hard to get them to leave, and any disturbance of their activities by using a repellent (not that any would work well in this case) or insecticide spray would doom the baby bees in burrows\u00a0to starvation since they cannot acquire their own food. A soil-applied insecticide might also risk harming other insects if absorbed by nearby plant roots.\u00a0The period of activity\u00a0for adult ground-nesting bees is relatively brief (a few weeks, typically) since most species\u00a0rely on the blooms of a very particular group of\u00a0plants that won't be\u00a0blooming all summer, so once they are finished stocking the burrows with food for the larvae the adults leave or die off. Since they do not sting people to defend their nests, and since these burrows\u00a0can actually benefit soil and root health because of its soil aeration, management of ground-nesting bees is not needed or recommended if it's possible to live with them.  If the bees didn't stay in the neighbor's or nearby\u00a0yards, it could have been because the soil there was less suitable for nesting (maybe too poorly-drained or too compacted from foot traffic) or they may have applied insecticide (grub control, anything)\u00a0or some other pesticide to the yard. Even products not intended for insect control (like weed killer or a fungicide) can have harmful impacts on bees. There are hundreds of species of bees found in Maryland (plus solitary wasps that nest in the ground too, but don't sting people)\u00a0and their nesting habitat preferences will differ, so without knowing which type these were, it's hard to say what exact conditions they prefer. Therefore, it's hard to say what conditions will discourage them from coming back, but as we've mentioned so far, compacted soil (which is\u00a0not good for plant roots) and soil covered in a barrier like mulch that's hard for them to dig though is not likely to appeal to them. A living groundcover is also not generally what they seek to nest under, as most prefer exposed soil.  If you see more of the bees (granted, this might not occur until next year when the new generation of adults emerge), sharing photos with us of the bees themselves and the style of burrow (with a soil\u00a0pile next to it, for example)\u00a0is helpful for trying to identify them in order\u00a0to know what conditions may be\u00a0attracting them. You can try again with the primrose if you prefer, though generally they struggle in Maryland weather conditions (heat, mainly) and are not common components of area gardens.  Miri\nuser: Dear, Charlie, Thank you for the detailed information you provided!\u00a0 I should have taken photos of the bees and their burrows but my mind was so focused on getting rid of them that I didn\u2019t think of it.\u00a0 The reason I think that the bees destroyed my primroses is that I saw them going in at the roots of the primroses and when I went to prune the spent primroses the primroses just came up in my hands with the little roots they had left..\u00a0 I have these primroses for at least 10 years and this has never happened before.\u00a0 Also there was nothing blooming in my yard when the bees came, the daffodils, the hyacinths and primroses had already made their appearance and gone so there was no pollen for these bees to collect and to my thinking that\u2019s why they went for the primroses roots.\u00a0 There was a lavender beginning to bloom but I didn\u2019t see these bees going in at the roots as much, because I think the lavender roots are more woodsy and primrose roots are more succulent.\u00a0 But that\u2019s my nonscientific brain trying to make sense of why the bees were so keen on the primroses. \u00a0  Next time I will forgo all the dumb home remedies and chemicals and email you, with photos, immediately.\u00a0  \u00a0  Thank you very much for such a detailed email. Zeba\nexpert: Hi, Emerson,  You're welcome. That's quite alright, it can be hard to get good photos of those busy little bees anyway, but we'll see what happens with them next year when the new generation appears. Bees won't feed on plant roots (they can't use them as source of food) and while digging into the root zone might disturb a plant a little, we doubt this was what happened or would have been drastic enough by itself\u00a0to kill a plant, especially given that this affected all of the plants equally severely. A soil-borne infection of the roots or some other explanation unrelated to the bees\u00a0is more likely. Even if a nectar or pollen source wasn't available in your garden beds at the time, they can fly enough distance to find what they need (and sometimes they're actually collecting tree pollen beyond our notice).  Miri\nuser: Hi, Charlie, The bees only effected my primroses (to my observation) and no other plants and now there are only about four primroses left.\u00a0 Though there were burrows all over my non-grass yard I only saw them going into the root base of the primroses.\u00a0 Literally there were hundreds of bees in my little yard.\u00a0 My yard was not mulched at the time and even when I mulched it they kept going into the roots of the primroses.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t bother the clematis or other plants that had just started to emerge.\u00a0 Why the heck did they appear when there were no plants for them to collect the nectar?\u00a0 There are lots of trees where I live so maybe they were collecting tree pollen.\u00a0 Is it possible they were another species of bee or wasp?\u00a0 They didn\u2019t bother or bite me just buzzed around when I was pruning my primroses.\u00a0 I also read that these bees maybe eating Japanese Beetle\u2019s grubs which I have had in the past and had to pull out my knockout rose bushes because the Japanese Beetles wouldn\u2019t leave them alone for four years in a row.\u00a0 I promise I will not use chemicals anymore on my front yard \u2013 it was just the exasperation with the digger bees that drove me to it. \u00a0  Thanks so much for invaluable information.\u00a0 I have learned so much more about digger bees and I want to thank you for taking the time to explain all their habits to me. Zeba\nexpert: Without images of the bees in question we can't make any more guesses about what they were doing in such close proximity to the primrose plants, except to say that it's highly unlikely they intentionally damaged any roots. Yes, it's possible they were a ground-nesting wasp, though in this situation they would not be one of the species likely to bother people (like Yellowjackets) as they are nesting singly. They would not be Cicada Killer Wasps, as they don't emerge that early (and they're unmistakably large), and probably were not grub-hunting wasps as they tend to appear later in the season than these did as well.  Ground-nesting bees and wasps\u00a0can appear without nectar plants in the immediate vicinity because they will fly a certain distance (maybe halfway across the neighborhood, it really depends on the bee) to forage for the flowers that suit their needs. If they are wasps, the adults will visit flowers for nectar but the rest of the time they are looking for insect prey for their nest, so the presence of flowers nearby isn't a deal-breaker for them.\u00a0Some bees are very particular about what plant nectar or pollen they can use. As we mentioned before, it might be that your yard had less chemical exposure and just the right type of soil for their nesting needs that allowed them to nest in your yard but not the nearby yards.  You're welcome, and feel free to send us pictures of the bees/wasps if they appear again in the future.  Miri\nuser: Dear, Charlie, Thank you for all the help and information you provided. Next year I will be ready with my camera to capture these insects and photos of their nests. Take care, Zeba\n",

One looks great while the other has a lot of die back on the inner lower leaves. The other has no die back at all. Also the unhealthy one looks much less green than the other, a duller green than the other one. I have noticed that the underside of the branches are brighter green than the tops. It gets about an hour less sun than the healthy one. The one photo show you the healthy tree (far left) compared to the unhealthy tree (far right). Another photo shows die back, and the other show unhealthy tree branches. Any thought are appreciated, Thanks, Peyton\nexpert: Hi, Peyton, I\u00a0suspect the difference from one tree to the other\u00a0could be related to a water or root issue. And this looks like a variety of northern white cedar; I'm not familiar with the name sullivan pine.\u00a0 The overall difference in color from the tree on the left may be because of too much or too little water that the tree is receiving. It could also be that the tree was planted too deep, or with girdling roots, both of which may cause the tree stress which could lead to the duller green color. You can look under the branches and check to be sure the trunk widens a bit before the soil begins, and be sure that the mulch is pulled back 12-18\"\u00a0from the trunk itself. It's not great for the mulch to be right up against the trunk, it's better if mulch just covers the root base.\u00a0  I\u00a0suspect the dying inner branches/leaves may be a fungal issue, likely caused by out extremely wet spring and summer (not include the past couple of days!). Below is a link to an article on arborvitae (which is another name for northern white cedar) needle blight. Please take a look, and compare the pictures to what you have been observing on the cedar.\u00a0 https://ag.umass.edu/landscape/fact-sheets/arborvitae-needle-blight This is treatable using a fungicide on the elongating new growth in the spring. You can also prune out the affected branches now, to prevent spores from the fungus causing the needle blight from spreading. Then, dispose of them offsite as the branches will continue to produce spores. You may\u00a0dispose of them in trash destined for the landfill, or burn if its safe to do so.\u00a0  There is a lot of information in this reply. Please do feel free to reach out if you have any questions.\u00a0  Thank you, -Julie\nuser: Julie, Thanks for the quick reply. I just found the label from the Sullivan and it is a Sullivan False cypress. Does this change any of your thoughts?  If not, do you think I can apply a fungicide now? Also the branches that have the die back are very large bottom branches, cur=tting back will really alter the look of the tree. Do you still think this is a good idea?

        "utterance": "Hi, Peyton, thank you for the update. Knowing that the tree is a Sullivan False Cypress does change the approach slightly. While the general advice about checking for root issues and ensuring proper watering still applies, the specific fungal issues might differ. For False Cypress, it's important to ensure good air circulation and avoid overhead watering to prevent fungal diseases. \n\nRegarding the application of fungicide, it's generally best to apply it during the growing season when new growth is elongating, as this is when the tree is most vulnerable to fungal infections. However, if you are seeing active dieback, it might be beneficial to apply a fungicide now to prevent further spread, but ensure you follow the product's instructions carefully.\n\nAs for pruning, if the branches with dieback are large and removing them would significantly alter the tree's appearance, you might consider consulting with a local arborist to assess the best course of action. They can provide guidance on whether selective pruning or other treatments might be more appropriate.\n\nI hope this helps, and feel free to reach out if you have more questions. Best, Julie",

        "utterance": "Based on the information provided, it seems like your shrubs might be experiencing stress due to a combination of factors such as age, watering practices, and possibly soil conditions. Here are a few steps you can take: \n\n1. **Watering Adjustments**: Consider reducing the duration of watering sessions. Overwatering can lead to root rot, especially if the soil is prone to saturation. Instead, water deeply but less frequently, ensuring the soil has time to dry out between waterings.\n\n2. **Soil Drainage**: Check the soil drainage. If the soil is compacted or has poor drainage, consider aerating the soil or adding organic matter to improve it.\n\n3. **Pruning**: As you mentioned, giving the shrubs a good trim can help. Remove any dead or diseased branches to improve air circulation and reduce the spread of any potential disease.\n\n4. **Pest and Disease Check**: Inspect the plants for signs of pests or diseases. Look for any unusual spots, webs, or insects. If you find any, you may need to treat them with appropriate pesticides or fungicides.\n\n5. **Professional Assessment**: If the problem persists, consider consulting a local arborist or horticulturist who can provide a more detailed assessment and recommend specific treatments.\n\nBy addressing these factors, you can help improve the health of your shrubs and prevent further dieback.",

        "utterance": "Bill, your plan to treat the hornets' nest at night is a good strategy, as hornets are less active during this time, which reduces the risk of being stung. Ensure you wear protective clothing, including gloves and goggles, to minimize exposure. The Spectracide PRO you have should be effective, especially with its long spray reach. Aim to thoroughly soak the nest, focusing on the entrance where hornets enter and exit. One treatment may be sufficient, but monitor the nest the following day for any remaining activity. If hornets are still present, a second application may be necessary. Always prioritize safety and consider contacting a professional if the nest is large or if you feel uncomfortable handling it yourself.",

First, ensure that the tree is well-watered, especially during dry spells, as this will help it recover from stress. Applying a tree wrap can protect the damaged area from further harm and help retain moisture, but make sure it is breathable to prevent moisture buildup under the wrap. Additionally, consider applying a tree wound dressing or sealant to the damaged bark to protect it from pests and diseases. Keep an eye on the tree's overall health, and continue to protect it from further deer damage with the fence you've installed. If the damage is extensive or the tree's health continues to decline, consulting with a local arborist might be beneficial.",

        "utterance": "The symptoms you're describing, with tiny holes in the peppers followed by rotting, are often indicative of insect activity. In Vermont, common pests that could cause such damage include pepper maggots or European corn borers. These insects lay eggs on the peppers, and the larvae bore into the fruit, creating holes. Once the fruit is damaged, it becomes susceptible to secondary infections, which can lead to rotting. To manage this, you can monitor your plants for signs of these pests and consider using row covers to prevent the insects from laying eggs on the plants. Additionally, regular inspection and removal of affected fruits can help reduce the spread of the problem. If the issue persists, you might want to consult with a local extension service for more targeted pest control strategies.",

Here are some steps you can take to address the issue:\n\n1. **Fungicide Application**: Consider applying a fungicide specifically designed for lawn diseases. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for application rates and timing.\n\n2. **Watering Practices**: Since you've already turned off the sprinklers, it's important to adjust your watering schedule to prevent excess moisture. Water deeply but infrequently, ideally in the early morning to allow the grass to dry out during the day.\n\n3. **Mowing**: Keep your lawn mowed to the recommended height for your grass type, and ensure your mower blades are sharp to prevent tearing the grass.\n\n4. **Aeration**: Consider aerating your lawn to improve soil drainage and reduce compaction, which can help prevent fungal growth.\n\n5. **Fertilization**: Since you've recently applied fertilizer, monitor the lawn's response. Avoid over-fertilizing, as this can exacerbate fungal issues.\n\n6. **Soil Test**: Proceed with the soil test as planned. This will provide valuable information on nutrient levels and pH, allowing you to make informed decisions about future fertilization and soil amendments.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to improve the health of your lawn and reduce the spread of the fungus.

Hoverflies are beneficial insects as they are pollinators and their larvae can help control aphid populations. Since you are in Minnesota and it's winter, releasing it outside is not advisable as it would not survive the cold. Keeping it in a larger enclosure like a butterfly cage could allow it some space to move around, but given that hoverflies have a short lifespan, it may not survive until spring. If you are concerned about the ethics of keeping it, you might consider contacting a local entomologist or a pollinator conservation group to see if they can take it. Regarding your amaryllis bulb, if you suspect larvae inside, it might be best to dispose of the bulb to prevent any potential pest issues.",

The presence of mushy wood and flaking bark at the base is indicative of this. The pill bugs are likely not the primary cause of the damage but are attracted to the decaying material. To safely remove the dead wood, gently probe the area with your fingers or a small tool to identify the mushy, dead sections. You can remove these parts by hand, being careful not to disturb the healthy tissue. The bud union, where the graft is located, is typically a swollen area at the base of the plant. When removing dead wood, stop when you reach firm, healthy wood or the bud union to avoid damaging the graft. Since the plant is still producing buds and the shoots are healthy, it may recover well with proper care. Ensure good drainage and avoid overwatering to prevent further rot.

        "utterance": "Given the space constraints in your backyard, planting the Magnolia Alta tree closer than the recommended 18 feet could potentially lead to issues as the tree matures. However, since the Magnolia Alta is a relatively compact variety, you might be able to plant it closer with some considerations. Ensure that the tree is regularly pruned to manage its size and shape, which can help mitigate potential issues with roots or branches encroaching on structures. Additionally, consider planting it in a location where it has the most room to grow away from the house and other structures, such as the corner you mentioned, while still maintaining as much distance as possible. Regular monitoring and maintenance will be key to ensuring the tree remains healthy and does not cause damage.",

Have had other gardeners recently (including those on GrowWithKare11 facebook page), identify a plant we noticed last year on our hillside/yard, that is taking over the beautiful field grass we've grown accustomed to the last 30+ yrs. and slowly showing up elsewhere in our yard.  Majority all say it's Garlic Mustard.  Have no idea where it came from, but have been told to cut down before it flowers, get out at root if possible, but it's a long standing weed unfortunately.  Understand too it's edible, but a hillside of it, not appreciated. Many suggest Round Up applications for years.  Any other thoughts/suggestions would be appreciated!\nexpert: Thank you for writing.\u00a0\u00a0 Getting rid of garlic mustard is difficult becuase seeds remain viable in the soil for 10 years. Pulling individual garlic mustard plants by hand is the simplest and most effective approach to managing small or isolated infestations. When pulling plants, it is important to remove the upper portion of the roots as well as the stem, since buds in the root crown can produce additional stems. All pulled plants should be removed from the site as seed ripening continues even after plants are pulled. Repeatedly hand pulling of garlic mustard is effective for control in small areas but has limitations because seeds remain viable in the soil for up to 10 years. Therefore, it is important to pull all garlic mustard plants in an area every year until the seed bank is exhausted and seedlings no longer appear. This will require multiple efforts each year as rosettes can continue to bolt and produce flowers over an extended period (april-june).\u00a0\u00a0HTTPS://WWW.CANR.MSU.EDU/IPM/INVASIVE_SPECIES/GARLIC_MUSTARD/MANAGEMENT_OPTIONS#:~:TEXT=IN%20MEDIUM%20TO%20LARGE%20SIZED,TO%20LIMIT%20GARLIC%20MUSTARD'S%20SPREAD.

A burn will kill surface plants but will not kill seeds that are deep in the soil and viable for 10 years. Round Up only kills plants that are actively growing.\u00a0 Again, it does not kill seeds.\u00a0 Immediately put pulled weeds in a bag and send to a dump--the seeds continue to ripen after the plant has been\u00a0pulled.\u00a0 As the resource on solarization that I sent you states, clear plastic is significantly more effective than black.\u00a0 Another reference for you. https://extension.psu.edu/garlic-mustard\nuser: Thank you for your input again, Steve!

If these efforts are not sufficient, you might consider contacting a local professional landscaping service that specializes in invasive plant management.

They may have resources or programs to assist homeowners dealing with invasive species. As for disposal, it's best to put the bagged plants in your regular garbage to ensure the seeds do not spread further. Yard waste sites might not be equipped to handle invasive species properly.",

There are plenty of new canes.  Does the 'infection' affect the entire plant, or just floricanes?   Is the soil likely infected, too?\nexpert: Hi- anthracnose and cane blight are common diseases of blackberry plants in MD. If the cane and fruit symptoms are widespread you may want to consider removing all plants. If the symptoms are more limited, prune out, bag, and discard all symptomatic canes (don't let the prunings touch the ground). These diseases infect floricanes and primocanes. They don't live in the soil but overwinter on infected plant parts.  Liquid lime sulfur is a low-risk \"organic\" fungicide labeled for use in the dormant season that can help control both diseases.

        "utterance": "Copper octanoate is generally effective as a fungicide for controlling diseases in blackberries, including anthracnose. Since you've already removed the affected canes, applying the fungicide can help protect the remaining healthy plants. It's best to apply fungicides early in the morning or at dusk to minimize plant stress, especially during hot weather. This timing helps avoid the hottest part of the day, reducing the risk of leaf burn and ensuring better absorption. Make sure to follow the label instructions for application rates and safety precautions. If you're concerned about residue on the fruit, check the pre-harvest interval on the label to ensure safe consumption.",

One effective approach is to use deer repellents, which can be either commercial products or homemade solutions like a mixture of eggs, water, and garlic. Another option is to install physical barriers such as deer netting or fencing around your hostas. Additionally, you can plant deer-resistant plants around your hostas to deter them. Motion-activated sprinklers can also be effective in startling deer and keeping them away. It's important to regularly change your methods, as deer can become accustomed to certain deterrents over time.",

Because so little sprouted, the lawn service returned on April 27 to \"remediate\": which involved spreading a thin layer of soil and re-seeding.  The fescue slowly sprouted, as I followed the watering instructions, but weeds grew faster.  I tried to weed, but got a late start for medical reasons, and was able to a first clearing of perhaps 2/3.  The rest is completely covered with weeds, and difficult at this point to remove by hand.  So I am wondering what to do.  I have replanted this lawn before, but never has there been such an explosion of weeds. The grass underneath the weeds is doing pretty well, and if I could just remove the weeds, I think the lawn would grow in nicely.  The first photo (5020) shows the unweeded part as of July 6.

        "utterance": "Stewart, it sounds like you're committed to maintaining an organic lawn, which is great. Since Fiesta didn't adhere well to most of the weed leaves, you might want to consider a few alternative strategies. First, ensure that you are applying the product under optimal conditions, such as when the weeds are actively growing and the weather is not too hot or windy, which can affect adhesion. You could also try using a surfactant, which can help the herbicide stick better to the leaves. Additionally, consider spot-treating the weeds with a more concentrated solution if the product label allows for it. Another approach is to increase the density of your fescue by overseeding in the fall, which can help outcompete the weeds. Regular mowing at the correct height can also help by preventing weeds from setting seed. Lastly, maintaining a healthy soil ecosystem with proper aeration and organic matter can naturally suppress weed growth over time. I hope these suggestions help you achieve a lush, weed-free lawn organically.",

Here are the answers to your questions:What is the plant?- I do not know exactly what it is called. It is a bush about 9 feet tall that has small red berries that grow on it. The leaves are smooth, not pokey like a holly. It also has sprouts that come out of its shallow roots, if that is at all helpful. I have seen other bushes like this \u00a0around the Salem area so I think they are somewhat common.When did you first notice the webbing and/or damage to the leaves?- we were gone for a long vacation, but when we returned I noticed the webbing, but no damaged leaves. That was on July 4th. It has just within the last week started turning brown and more of the bush now has webbing on it and in the original area of webbing the leaves are falling off.

The same root cluster may also have unaffected stems.  Photos show whole bed, whole plant, and stem sections from the root (very black).  Stem transitions to 'green and clean' higher up in infected but not dead plants.  Has been proceeding for about a month.\r\n\r\nnote: nursery shrubs (mountain mint and others) were recently planted 10 feet away, and road crews reseeded nearby grass after a curb repair.\nexpert: This appears to be a commonplace fungal blight called Phoma or Phomopsis. Even though such diseases are more prevalent in wet weather or in conditions of poor drainage, they can also more easily affect plants that are stressed for other reasons, such as drought. (We are currently in a drought and many landscape plants likely would benefit from occasional irrigation if you are not already doing so.)  Ironically, irrigation that wets foliage instead of only soil may exacerbate the situation because wet leaf surfaces are more vulnerable to infection, though these plants lie too low to the ground to make most drip or soaker-hose irrigation a practical alternative. Watering early enough in the day so foliage can dry by nightfall may help, but nothing is going to cure existing infections. Similarly, we do not recommend fungicide as a preventative treatment as such measures do not always work well (if they work at all) and because pesticides can cause harm to other organisms, even if only intended for certain issues (a fungus in this case). Plus, Vinca is an invasive species in our region and we don't encourage gardeners to keep it, if you're willing to replace it with a different mix of groundcovers. A mix of species is also less likely to succumb to the same issues because they will have different vulnerabilities and tolerances to stress.  For now, the best way to remedy the situation is to severely cut back all stems (withered or otherwise)\u00a0close to the ground (a weed-whacker is probably the simplest tool for this), rake or leaf-blow out any debris (like rotted-off stems, shed Vinca leaves, and other fallen tree leaves), and let the Vinca regrow. This serves to remove most of the spore production while also improving air circulation in an overgrown patch to reduce the incidence of recurring disease.\u00a0If the Vinca root systems are otherwise healthy, regrowth should not unduly stress the plants, unless they are simultaneously drought-stressed. Don't fertilize as the roots won't need it and the lush growth that can result from nutrient supplementation may also be more vulnerable to infection than growth produced at a plant's normal pace.  It's quite possible that a low-level presence of these fungi were in the Vinca bed for some time prior to this season\u00a0but not noticeable, and only now flared-up due to accumulated stresses, like from drought.  Miri\nuser: Also, disposal of the cut back material?\n",
        "decision": "<Respond>",
        "utterance": "After cutting back the vinca, it's important to properly dispose of the infected plant material to prevent the spread of the fungal spores. You should bag the debris and dispose of it in the trash rather than composting it, as the composting process may not reach temperatures high enough to kill the pathogens. As for watering, a single deep watering after the cut back can be beneficial, especially if the area is experiencing drought conditions. This will help the plants recover and encourage healthy regrowth. Ensure that the watering is done early in the day to allow the foliage to dry by nightfall, reducing the risk of further fungal infections.",

        "utterance": "It's good to hear that the trunk of your peach tree is not in bad shape. Regarding your question about fertilizing with Miracle-Gro in the fall, it is generally safe to apply a modest amount of soluble nitrogen under the canopy. You can water all under the tree canopy, not just at the edge, to ensure even distribution. However, be cautious not to over-fertilize, as too much nitrogen can prevent the tree from settling down for winter. Since you've noticed some leaf curl, consider applying a copper spray in late fall or very early spring to manage this fungal disease.

        "utterance": "Based on the information you've provided, it seems like your Arctic Fire dogwood bushes might be experiencing transplant shock, which is common in the first season after planting. The clay content in your soil could be contributing to poor drainage, which might lead to root rot if the soil remains too wet. It's good that you plan to check the root system; look for any signs of rot or damage. Ensure that the planting depth is correct and that the root flare is visible at the soil surface. If the roots appear healthy and the soil is not overly saturated, consider adjusting your watering schedule to allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings. Additionally, since the plants were dormant when planted, they might still be adjusting to their new environment. If the roots are healthy, they may recover and send up new growth. Keep an eye on the flexibility of the branches, as this is a positive sign.

The unusual heat wave might be stressing the plants, especially if they are not regularly watered. While hydrangeas can tolerate some heat, consistent moisture is crucial, particularly during heat waves. The fact that the yellowing is starting in the understory suggests that the lower leaves might not be getting enough light or air circulation, which can be exacerbated by heat stress. Additionally, the use of a granular fertilizer in the spring should generally be sufficient, but over-fertilization can sometimes lead to nutrient imbalances, which might also cause yellowing. Since the dogwood tree is unaffected, it might be more resilient to these conditions or have a different root system that accesses water differently. I recommend ensuring consistent watering during hot periods, checking for any signs of pests or diseases, and possibly testing the soil for nutrient levels to rule out any deficiencies or excesses.

The flowers between those two genera are very different in shape and color, though, so if you explore those linked pages and neither looks close in bloom shape, we may need to wait for the plant to bloom again before we can make another guess.  Miri\nuser: Thank you! I will study any new blooms. I think it is Virginia dayflower.

This plant is native to parts of North America and is not considered invasive in its native range. However, it can spread easily in garden settings, which might be why you considered it a weed. Since you've already disposed of it, there's no further action needed. If you encounter similar plants in the future and wish to manage them, regular monitoring and removal can help control their spread.",

What are they and how do I get rid of them?\nexpert: The insects you have are beetles, it is hard to say if you have carpet beetles, storage pest beetles or wood boring beetles. It would be helpful if you could examine your food storage area such as a pantry for any signs of an infestation in the food packages. The other type of beetle carpet beetles can damage items such a any products that have dried organic parts such as wool clothing, furs, dried flower arrangements, feathers as examples. The last kind are wood boring beetles, The damage they cause are to wooden furniture where they leave fine power where they bored into wooden furniture. I have attached a publication on these three types of beetles. If you can, read them and let me know if one matches the problem you have with these beetles.

Rich\nuser: Hi, Quinn,\u00a0Thank you so much for sending this information\u2014it is extremely helpful. Except that I don\u2019t think any of these are the beetles I have. I\u2019ve definitely ruled out the carpet beetles--my beetles don\u2019t look anything like any of the three that are shown in Pub 7436. For one thing, my beetles do not have short antennae, their antennae are long. I\u2019ve also ruled out the various kinds of pantry beetles. For one thing, my beetles are tiny compared to those shown as \"actual size.\u201d For another, I have zero evidence of infestation in any of my food storage areas, and believe me, I checked very carefully!\u00a0So that leaves the powderpost beetles. At first I thought they might be a possible candidate, especially because the upstairs room where my beetles are most pronounced, and in which they appeared first, is completely paneled in wood! However, close reading of PNW 326 leads me to the conclusion that they are not my beetle. My beetle is medium brown with an almost greenish tint; its body is definitely not \"dark brown to nearly black\" (lyctidae), or \"reddish-brown to nearly black\u201d (anobiids and bostrichids). My beetle has antenna that are very skinny and very long, almost a third as long as its head/body; its antenna do not look like any of the pictured antenna. My beetle has gold-colored legs. I do not see any exit (emergence) holes in the wood, nor any powdery frass.I am wondering what to do next. I wouldn\u2019t be concerned because I\u2019ve always just vacuumed them up when they showed up every spring (this has been going on pretty much ever since I moved in 40 years ago). But now, I\u2019m seeing them all year round (though not in the great numbers I see every spring). And, as I mentioned, they are now for the first time showing up in other parts of the house, including a few downstairs! Would it be possible to gather some and bring them down to show you? I really don\u2019t want to \u201cemploy a professional\u2026insecticide or fumigant\u201d unless I have to.

In Oregon, managing elm leaf beetles typically involves a combination of cultural, mechanical, and chemical controls. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. **Cultural Control**: Ensure that any elm trees near your home are healthy and well-maintained. Prune any dead or infested branches to reduce beetle populations.\n\n2. **Mechanical Control**: Seal any cracks or openings in your home to prevent beetles from entering. Regularly vacuum areas where beetles are found to physically remove them.\n\n3. **Chemical Control**: If necessary, you can use insecticides specifically labeled for elm leaf beetles. Look for products containing active ingredients like permethrin or bifenthrin. Apply these according to the label instructions, focusing on areas where beetles are most active.\n\n4. **Professional Help**: If the infestation is severe, consider consulting a pest control professional who can provide targeted treatments.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further assistance or specific recommendations for products available in your area.",

Please advise.\nexpert: Dear, Riley,  Thank you for contacting us about the leaf spots on plants throughout your garden. Leaf spots are caused by a number of\u00a0 ubiquitous fungal pathogens. They are in the air as well as the soil, and they can take hold whenever the conditions for them are right. Cool, wet springs followed by warm, dry summers provide the perfect combination for fungal leaf spots.  Fungal diseases are common with our weather conditions. The leaf spots are unsightly but not usually dangerous to your plants. Once a fungal disease arises, it is very difficult to get rid of it. Copper sprays or bordeaux mix may help, but the key to effective management is prevention and containment.*\u00a0  Choose the right plant for the site based on sun, soil, and soil moisture. Choose resistant varieties of plants\u00a0when available Prune plants to allow good airflow through and between them. Clean up plant debris regularly and especially after the\u00a0leaves drop in the autumn. Use 2 to 3 inches of wood chips or another organic mulch at all times to reduce reinfection through rain splash. Mulch will also retain moisture in the soil and help prevent soil compaction.  \u00a0We can't do much about the weather. Unfortunately, the same can be said of many fungal leaf spots. I do hope this information helps you to contain the problem.\u00a0  *A fairly effective preventative measure to use\u00a0before a fungal infection sets in is to spray plants with a 1:3 mixture of 2% milk and water. However, it may not practical to spray all of your plants.\nuser: I removed almost every leaf from my pear tree. All the other trees I removed about 1/3. Was this a good idea or more harmful then helpful? Also, my strawberries are all infected and I read that you\u2019re supposed to mow them down. Is that true? Should I remove all of the leaves from them as well?What I don\u2019t know is if this fungicide will prevent the fruit from growing.\u00a0 I\u2019m not concerned about my strawberries this year as they are year one. But I am concerned about what they will produce next year. I have straw as mulch around all of my plants. do I need to dispose of the straw? I\u2019ve read so much on the Internet and I just don\u2019t want to get things wrong.\u00a0 I really appreciate your advice.\nexpert: Dear, Riley,  Thanks for the additional information. The reason I did not recommend removing spotted leaves is because they do not normally cause damage to the plant. Removing the leaves reduces the plant's ability to photosynthesize. Without the ability to make food, the plant may weaken and die. If your trees are able to\u00a0refoliate, they may make it through the summer but they may not be able\u00a0to make it through the winter.\u00a0  Perhaps we should back up a bit and go through the process of Integrated Pest Management (IPM). IPM looks for the least toxic controls needed to be effective.\u00a0When there is a problem with a plant, the critical step is to correctly identify the pest or disease. Without this information it is not possible to select the appropriate course of action.\u00a0  Next, determine whether action is truly\u00a0needed. Pest damage, fungal spots, even some wilting are all normal in many circumstances ,so determine your tolerance.\u00a0If a pest is present\u00a0and exceeds your\u00a0threshold for damage, use the least toxic\u00a0remedy that is effective. Control methods are (in order)\u00a0cultivation, mechanical, biological, and lastly chemical controls. For more, see\u00a0IPM for Home Gardeners https://youtu.be/wr2R6k77EgQ  Since your fungal issues affect nearly all of your plants, I would not recommend removing any but the most unsightly leaves, otherwise you may do more harm to the plant than the fungal infection.\u00a0  The law requires that all fungicides (an other pesticides)\u00a0 must be used according to the package directions. The label will specify on which\u00a0plants the product may be used, when, and how much.\u00a0When used as directed, it should not\u00a0harm your plants. The product label should also\u00a0indicate whether it is safe for use on food crops and how long you should wait before harvest. If you have questions, you should call the toll-free number on the label and talk with the manufacturer.\u00a0\u00a0  With regard to strawberries, this article\u00a0may be helpful.\u00a0 https://extension.umn.edu/strawberry-farming/strawberry-end-season-renovation  OSU recommends purchasing new strawberry plants each year, but if you choose to reuse the existing plants note that fungal spores may overwinter in the soil. I suggest cutting the foliage an inch or so above the crowns and raking up all plant debris and mulch. Replace the straw and fertilize as usual.\u00a0  I do hope your plants remain healthy in spite of the fungal spots. If you have an especially bad problem that jeopardizes your trees, I suggest you take plant samples to the Marion County Extension office for closer\u00a0inspection:\u00a0 1320 Capitol St NE #110, Salem, OR 97301 Garden Help Desk: 503.373.3770\nuser: Thank you so much Lynne.

You can also try pouring boiling water directly onto the thistle plants, which can kill the above-ground parts and potentially damage the roots. Be cautious to avoid the maple sapling's roots. Another option is to use a vinegar-based herbicide, which is less harmful to the environment. Apply it carefully to the thistle leaves on a sunny day to maximize its effectiveness.

The yellowing and browning of leaves can often be attributed to environmental stress, such as inconsistent watering or nutrient deficiencies. Since you've already adjusted your watering, it might be helpful to check the soil drainage and ensure it's not waterlogged, as elderberries prefer well-drained soil. Additionally, consider testing the soil for nutrient levels, particularly nitrogen, as deficiencies can cause yellowing leaves. If the soil is compacted, aerating it might also help improve root health.

Missouri Botanical Gardens has a plant profile page about them that you can review. They can be susceptible to fungal leaf spots which is often caused from excessive\u00a0rain (we haven't had that) or overhead watering, but these symptoms don't look like that. It could possibly be from the drought conditions we are experiencing, they do like evenly moist soil conditions, especially if they receive more mid or\u00a0late day stronger sun (although we suspect the leaf tips would be turning more brown and 'crispy' if they were dry). What is your watering schedule for these?\u00a0 Or it could be the beginning signs of powdery mildew. Despite our dry conditions, powdery mildew\u00a0is still showing up on landscape plants.\u00a0 There isn't a treatment that you can do or is warranted right now, just monitor the symptoms and let us know if the plant seems to be failing drastically. When supplementing watering needs, make sure to water at the base of the plant and try to avoid getting the leaves wet or splashing water on them. This can help curb any leaf spot or fungal diseases. With our generally humid Mid-Atlantic weather, fungus is just a part of life unfortunately, but most of the time it just causes a somewhat unsightly appearance and not devastating health effects to the plant.\u00a0 Please feel free to reach back out if there are worsening symptoms or decline. Emily\nuser: Hi, Emerson,    This Hydrangea serrata is by itself and there are 3 others 10 feet away doing just fine. You are probably correct about the watering. Since they haven't drooped at all, I haven't been watering. The foliage looks perky in dappled dry shade all day. No direct sunlight, as are the other 3. And all 4 are beginning to flower. I will start watering the ground (not the plants) twice a week deeply if we aren't getting a soaking rain. If you don't think it's a fugal issue, I won't spray with a copper fungicide.

Since the other Hydrangeas are doing well and the affected plant is in similar conditions, starting a regular deep watering schedule should help, especially given the dry conditions.

The yard was grass previously but had been largely overtaken by dandelions and other weeds. We removed all the grass and weeds by tilling and  hauling away all the grass/weeds.  We have a blank dirt slate and plan to do a mixture of ground covers and flagstones. Initially we were going to put down a weed barrier fabric, then top with mulch, before placing stones and planting ground covers. After some research, it sounds like weed barrier fabric is not necessarily the recommended route. That said, because  of the density of weeds that we\u2019re in the area before,  we\u2019re hesitant to use only mulch (2-3inches) for fear of weeds popping right back up before our ground cover has a chance to spread/mature.

        "decision": "<Respond>",
        "utterance": "Given your situation, using a combination of methods might be the most effective approach. Since you've already tilled and removed the existing weeds, applying a high-concentration vinegar solution can help kill any remaining weed seeds and taproots. This should be applied directly to the soil, as vinegar is a non-selective herbicide that can affect any plant tissue it contacts. However, it is most effective on the leaves of plants, so ensure thorough soil saturation to reach any hidden roots. \n\nAfter treating the soil, consider using a layer of cardboard as a biodegradable weed barrier. This can be placed directly on the soil before adding a 2-3 inch layer of mulch. The cardboard will suppress weed growth while allowing water and nutrients to reach your ground covers. Over time, it will decompose and enrich the soil. \n\nThis method, combined with regular maintenance and monitoring, should help manage weed growth as your ground covers establish themselves. Be cautious with the use of vinegar near desired plants, as it can harm them as well. If you choose to use glyphosate, it is most effective when applied to the leaves of actively growing weeds, so it may not be suitable for your current bare soil situation.",

YOUR QUESTION #0145308: Can I shape mature (relatively) River Birch We have two river birch trees that were more \"dome\" shaped (and smaller, of course) when we purchased our home about four years ago. We have been receiving mixed messages from tree companies regarding shaping / trimming them back to be dome shaped, as (poorly) shown in the captioned attachment. Other photos are of one of the trees today. I'm guessing they are about 20' high. Can you please weigh in on this?

        "utterance": "Hello, Skyler, thank you for your patience. River Birch trees can indeed be pruned, but it's important to do so correctly to avoid damage. Pruning should ideally be done in late fall or winter when the tree is dormant. This minimizes sap loss and stress on the tree. When shaping, avoid cutting too close to the trunk or main branches, as this can indeed harm the tree. Instead, focus on thinning out smaller branches to maintain the desired shape. It's also crucial to use clean, sharp tools to make precise cuts. If you're unsure, consulting with a certified arborist who has experience with River Birch trees can provide more personalized guidance. I hope this helps!",

        "decision": "<Respond>",
        "utterance": "It sounds like your calendula is indeed serving its purpose as a companion plant by attracting pests away from your vegetables. The presence of tiny cream-colored insects on the calendula could be aphids, which are common on these plants. The black mold you mentioned is likely sooty mold, which often grows on the honeydew excreted by aphids. Since you haven't observed aphids on your vegetables, the calendula is likely helping in that regard. \n\nFor the whiteflies on the kale, your use of yellow sticky cards is a good step. You might also consider using insecticidal soap or neem oil as additional measures, ensuring to apply them in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid harming beneficial insects. \n\nRegarding the insect mesh, repairing the holes caused by the groundhog will help prevent further pest issues. Regularly checking and maintaining the mesh can be crucial in keeping pests out. \n\nOverall, continue monitoring the situation, and if the calendula becomes too infested, you might consider removing the most affected plants to prevent the spread of pests and mold.",

Thanks for your help!\r\nJohn\nexpert: Hi, Jordan, Based on what I can see, that is tall fescue (genus Festuca)\u00a0rather than true crabgrass (genus Digitaria).\u00a0 Though tall fescue is often dubbed 'crabgrass,' unfortunately it is not the plant that can be controlled by certain selective herbicides labeled for 'crabgrass control' (they only work on the annual grassy weed).\u00a0 On the contrary, any chemical you would use to control the tall fescue will also damage your lawn.\u00a0\u00a0 Your options are: 1. Live with it. 2. Spray it with a non-selective herbicide, like glyphosate, then re-seed or re-sod the area with your desired species. 3.\u00a0 Dig it out, and then re-seed or re-sod. I hope this is helpful! Cordially, John\nuser: Good morning John, thanks for the prompt reply!I\u2019m going to use mechanical approach as primary with limited chemical controls.

At this stage, you likely have a better chance at good results if you wait until next spring (April) to get started.\u00a0\u00a0 Good luck!

The white ring you mentioned could be a sign of a fungal issue, possibly exacerbated by the previous aphid infestation. Before replanting, it's important to address the soil conditions. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. **Remove Affected Plants and Roots:** Carefully remove the dying bamboo and as much of the root system as possible to prevent any remaining pathogens from affecting new plants.\n\n2. **Improve Soil Drainage:** Since the soil is compacted, consider amending it with organic matter such as compost to improve drainage and aeration. This will help prevent future root rot.\n\n3. **Soil Treatment:** If you suspect fungal pathogens, you might consider treating the soil with a fungicide appropriate for soil-borne pathogens. However, ensure that the fungicide is safe for use in gardens and follow the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n4. **Replenish Nutrients:** Add a balanced fertilizer to replenish any nutrients that may have been depleted.\n\n5. **Monitor and Maintain:** After replanting, monitor the new plants closely for any signs of stress or disease, and maintain proper watering and care to ensure healthy growth.\n\nThese steps should help create a healthier environment for your new bamboo or any other plants you choose to grow.",

        "utterance": "To manage Chameleon plant in your lawn without harming the grass, you can try a few strategies. First, continue pulling the sprouts as soon as they appear; this can help weaken the plant over time by depleting its energy reserves. However, since Chameleon plant spreads via rhizomes, this alone may not be sufficient. Consider using a selective herbicide that targets broadleaf weeds but is safe for grass. Look for products containing active ingredients like 2,4-D, dicamba, or MCPP, which are often effective against broadleaf plants while sparing most grasses. Be sure to follow the label instructions carefully to avoid any damage to your lawn. Additionally, maintaining a healthy, dense lawn through proper mowing, watering, and fertilization can help prevent the spread of invasive plants by reducing the space available for them to establish. If the problem persists, you might need to consult with a local extension service or a professional landscaper for more targeted solutions.",

        "utterance": "Based on the symptoms you've described and the presence of sawdust on the trunk, it is possible that your Redbud tree is suffering from a borer infestation, which is common in older trees. Borers can cause significant damage by tunneling into the wood, leading to the decline you are observing. The age of the tree also suggests it might be nearing the end of its natural lifespan, as Redbuds typically live around 20-30 years. I recommend consulting with a certified arborist who can assess the tree in person and determine if borers are indeed the issue. They can also advise on whether treatment is feasible or if it might be time to consider replacing the tree. In the meantime, ensure the tree is not stressed by maintaining proper mulching and avoiding further pesticide use near the tree unless necessary.",

I hope this helps! Cordially, John\nuser: Hi, Jordan,   I have been watering the plant religiously every day. \u00a0Should I water twice a day? \u00a0They are in a container, as we have wildlife around where we live. \u00a0They face East. \u00a0Is it too much sun. \u00a0Appreciate your advice.

        "utterance": "Hi, Logan, since your tomatoes are in containers and facing East, they likely receive a good amount of morning sun, which is generally beneficial. However, during particularly hot days, the soil in containers can dry out quickly, even with daily watering. You might consider watering twice a day, especially during heat waves, to ensure consistent moisture. Additionally, using mulch on top of the soil can help retain moisture. As for sun exposure, East-facing is usually not too much sun, but if you notice the plants wilting or the soil drying out too quickly, a light shade cloth during the hottest part of the day could help. Keep monitoring the soil moisture and adjust as needed. I hope this helps improve your tomato growing experience! Best, John",

        "dialog_context": "user: Hello,\r\nI have 3 Endless Summer hydrangeas in front of my house that have gotten very large.  They do well in the spring but by July are getting pretty wilted and have lots of brown spots on the foliage-I think it just gets too hot and sunny in that area by then.  I have read that they should only be pruned to shape the plants, but I would really like them to be smaller.  How aggressively can I cut them back?  If I cut them back a lot-say, by half-is it possible that I would get no blooms this year but they might recover by next spring?  My other option would be to move them to another area with more shade but given their size, that won't be easy.  Thanks for any advice!\nexpert: The varieties in the hydrangea series 'Endless Summer' were bred to be reblooming, so this helps the plants produce at least some flowers each year when pruning or winter weather deprives them of the original set of flower buds. All hydrangeas in their group (Bigleaf Hydrangea, or Hydrangea macrophylla) bloom on old wood, which means the flower buds form on stem wood that grew the prior year. Buds are present and fully developed\u00a0on the plants during winter that will produce the first flush of flowers later this spring and early summer. Some varieties of Bigleaf Hydrangea, 'Endless Summer' included, are capable of also flowering on new wood, which refers to\u00a0the stem growth that they will be producing this summer. Since reblooming hydrangeas like these\u00a0do both, they bloom over a longer period of time overall and also have this added \"insurance\"\u00a0against losing too many old wood flower buds if the shrubs are pruned or if the winter is harsh (or we have a hard spring freeze after they've broken dormancy).  So, if you prune them now (or any time before the first flowers emerge), you will be removing the first stet of blooms for this year, but won't be taking off all blooms. Since flower removal\u00a0doesn't harm the plant's general health, that's fine to do as long as you don't mind reducing the amount of bloom they will produce this year. In that situation, pruning can be done around March.\u00a0Otherwise, they should be pruned around midsummer (July-ish) when those old-wood blooms are spent but new-wood buds can continue to grow anytime. We have heard from nursery growers that high summer heat (especially when our nights stay warm) is suspected of\u00a0causing reblooming to stagnate or peter-out\u00a0a bit, but in general, any impacts on summer bloom abundance won't be directly caused by winter pruning.\u00a0Pruning stimulates growth, though, so eventually the trimmed shrubs will still reach their typical mature size (3 to 5 feet high for this variety) if not re-pruned each year or so.  Bigleaf Hydrangeas can be grown in full sun when the conditions are just right (wholesale nursery growers do this routinely, but they also irrigate a lot), but usually in gardens they fare best when sited in a spot with some degree of midday or afternoon shade. Dappled light instead of deep shade is best so they have enough light to fuel decent blooming. (They will survive in heavy shade, they just won't bloom well.)  Either solution you propose\u00a0can work -- keeping them where they are now\u00a0but pruning once or twice a year to manage size,\u00a0or wrangling a one-time move of the shrubs\u00a0to a partly-shaded spot --\u00a0depending on which creates the least maintenance work for you or lessens the plants' overall stress. If the plants remain in full sun, then monitoring them for irrigation needs can help avoid some of the wilting, though some of it will be unavoidable in really hot weather, even when the roots have enough moisture. When watering, try to only wet the soil instead of the leaves in order to reduce the risk of leaf spot infections (more of a cosmetic issue than a serious health threat for the plant); if you need to use sprinkler which wets their leaves, run it\u00a0early enough in the day that the foliage has time to dry by nightfall.

        "utterance": "You're welcome! Based on the information provided and the images, it seems like your hydrangeas are indeed experiencing stress from the heat and sun exposure. Since 'Endless Summer' hydrangeas can bloom on both old and new wood, you have the flexibility to prune them to manage their size without completely sacrificing blooms for the year. Pruning them back by half in early spring will reduce the initial bloom but should still allow for some flowering later in the season. If you choose to keep them in their current location, ensure they receive adequate water, especially during hot spells, and try to water the soil directly to minimize leaf spot issues. If moving them to a shadier spot is feasible, it could reduce stress and improve their overall health, but it will require some effort. Consider which option aligns best with your maintenance preferences and the plant's long-term health.",

Since you've already applied it to the stems, it should help in controlling the regrowth.

        "utterance": "Given that your soil pH is around 6.0 and you are experiencing chlorosis, it is reasonable to consider adjusting the pH to better suit blueberries, which thrive in more acidic conditions (ideally between 4.5 and 5.5). Since you prefer organic methods, using Espoma Soil Acidifier is a good option to lower the pH. You can apply it according to the package instructions, which typically involves spreading it evenly over the soil and watering it in. As for iron, if chlorosis is evident, it might be beneficial to apply a chelated iron product specifically designed for acid-loving plants. Regarding the use of grasses, while some grasses can help with nutrient availability, they might also compete with your blueberries for resources. If you choose to plant grasses, ensure they are not too close to the blueberry roots. Muhly grasses and little blue stem are generally non-invasive and could be considered, but monitor their growth closely. Continue to monitor the soil pH and adjust as needed based on your upcoming soil test results.",

Given the recent weather conditions you mentioned, the extended period of snow and cold could have stressed the tree, leading to the unusual leaf coloration. Additionally, the lack of fertilization this year might contribute to nutrient deficiencies, which can also affect leaf color. Since the tree is otherwise healthy and flowering, it may not be a serious issue. However, to help the tree recover and maintain its health, consider applying a balanced, slow-release fertilizer specifically formulated for trees and shrubs.

        "utterance": "Based on your description and the fact that the nest has an opening at the top, it is likely a type of hanging bird nest. Many bird species, such as orioles or certain types of weaver birds, create hanging nests that are woven from natural materials like needles and twigs. The softness and collapsibility you described could be due to the materials used and the age of the nest. If you are able to observe any birds around the nest, it might help in identifying the specific species. However, if the nest is abandoned, it might be difficult to determine the exact bird species without further evidence.",

        "utterance": "Hi, Emerson, thanks for the additional details. For the browning yew, since it's near a gravel drive and not salted, winter desiccation could still be a factor, especially if it's exposed to wind. Consider using a burlap screen during winter to protect it from harsh winds. Also, ensure it's not overwatered or underwatered, as both can cause browning. \n\nRegarding the concrete box, since it might have been an artesian well, the soil could be compacted or have drainage issues. To collect soil samples, take several small samples from different areas of the box, about 6 inches deep, and mix them together to get a representative sample. You can contact your local extension office for specific instructions on where to send the samples for testing. Once you have the soil test results, we can better address any pH or nutrient issues. Meanwhile, consider using plants that tolerate alkaline conditions, such as lavender or sedum, until the soil is amended. Let me know if you need further assistance!",

You might consider consulting with a tree care professional to assess the root health and overall condition of the tree.

Could these plants have been accidentally over-sprayed\u00a0 from an adjoining garden? Or sprayed to address black soot (that can result from aphid activity)? Please let us know if you find any indicators. Meanwhile, black aphids are a common problem with onion family plants and they multiply rapidly, so here are some tips on aphids from our archives\u00a0in case that turns out to be the issue, or one of the issues. Many gardens host some aphids. On healthy plants, they don't cause much harm, and beneficial insects, including ladybugs and parasitic wasps, keep them in check. Aphids can become more of a problem when plants\u00a0are stressed by drought, poor soil conditions, overwintering or overcrowding. Unfortunately, aphids can reproduce at amazing speed and a large colony that can literally suck the life out of your plants. The key to dealing with them is knowing when you need to take action, and then having the right tricks up your sleeve to keep them under control. How to Identify Aphids: Often the first sign of an aphid infestation is twisted and curled leaves, yellowing foliage, stunted or dead shoots, and sluggish plant growth. Damage is usually most noticeable on shoot tips and new growth, along with unopened flower buds. When you take a closer look at these damaged plant parts, particularly on the undersides of young leaves and developing stems, you'll likely find lots of aphids crowded together. Aphids range in color from green to yellow, brown, red, or even black. Aphids cause damage by sucking sap from tender plant parts. As they feast, they excrete a sugary substance called honeydew. A fungus called sooty mold grows on the honeydew and blocks light from your plant, but is otherwise harmless. You can wash your plant leaves with water to get rid of the honeydew and sooty mold. How to Get Rid of Aphids: When an aphid population explodes and begins to cause noticeable damage to leaves, stems, and buds, it's time to act right away. The sooner you can deal with the infestation, the better chance you have of eliminating or controlling the aphids. Spray with Water: The safest and fastest way to control aphids is to spray them off your plants with a strong stream of water from the garden hose. Aphids are easily knocked off plants and once they are knocked off a plant, they rarely climb back on. Crush Aphids with your fingers:\u00a0\u00a0If the infestation isn't too heavy, you can squash aphids by gently rubbing your thumb and fingertips over your plants' leaves and stems wherever you see aphids. Check back every few days to see if you need to repeat the procedure. This can be done in conjunction with spraying with water.Insecticidal Soaps and Horticultural Oils: These controls are low-risk to people and the environment and can be applied to food crops. They'll kill aphids, but must be applied on a regular basis during heavy infestations, and also kill the very\u00a0beneficial insects that can keep aphid\u00a0\u00a0polulations in check, so this \u00a0would be recommended only if the first two were unsuccessful. . How to Prevent Aphids: Preventing large numbers of aphids from making themselves at home is possible. In addition to making sure your plants have the water, light, and nutrients they need, here are a few more ways to help keep aphid numbers down. Remove dead stems and weeds from around the plants. You can cover plants with a barrier to insects (like cheese cloth or row covers). You can also grow certain plants nearby to attract beneficial insects like lady bugs which eat aphids (plants like marigolds,calendula, sunflower, daisy, alyssum, or dill).

        "utterance": "Based on your detailed description and the images provided, it seems like you might be dealing with a type of fungal growth, possibly a type of bracket fungus or a similar organism that can appear on decaying wood or roots. These fungi can sometimes appear in areas where trees have been removed or where there is decaying organic matter underground. \n\nTo address this issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. **Physical Removal**: Carefully dig around the stumps to remove as much of the fungal mass as possible. This might involve removing some soil and any decaying wood or roots that are feeding the fungus.\n\n2. **Improve Drainage**: Since your yard includes wetland areas, improving drainage might help reduce the conditions that favor fungal growth. Consider installing drainage systems or regrading the area to prevent water accumulation.\n\n3. **Soil Treatment**: After removal, treat the area with a fungicide that is safe for use in residential areas. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for application.\n\n4. **Monitor and Maintain**: Keep an eye on the area for any new growth and repeat the removal and treatment process as necessary.\n\nIf the problem persists or if you're unsure about handling it yourself, consulting with a local arborist or a professional landscaper might be beneficial. They can provide more specific advice tailored to your yard's conditions. Additionally, if you suspect the presence of a specific type of fungus, a local extension service or university might be able to help with identification and further recommendations.",

        "utterance": "Given your situation, it's important to manage the bindweed effectively before seeding. Since you've already applied a weed and feed product recently, I would recommend waiting a bit longer before seeding to ensure the herbicide has time to work. Covering the area with plastic again could help suppress the bindweed by blocking sunlight, but it might not be necessary if you plan to seed soon. If you decide to wait until spring to seed, covering the area over winter could help reduce weed pressure. For now, monitor the area and manually remove any bindweed that emerges. If you choose to seed this fall, ensure the soil is well-prepared and free of weeds at the time of seeding. Good luck with your lawn!",

After looking at some pictures of Bittersweet, I'm not convinced that is what I have.

The leaves are smooth-edged with no teeth and grow up the branches in groups of 2-3 coming out in each direction, I have touched the shrubs with no toxic effects on my skin, and they do not grow berries like I see on the Bittersweet pictures online. I have seen the same species of shrub in other yards in my neighborhood on walks, which have grown larger than mine since they have more spacing (over 12' tall compared to 7' for mine). I have attached a couple more pictures that will hopefully help with identification. The row is along the edge of my vegetable garden, so you may see some dead vines from last year's squash.\n",

        "utterance": "It sounds like the main issue is inadequate drainage, which is causing the soil at the bottom of the pot to remain too wet. Here are a few steps you can take to improve the situation:\n\n1. **Improve Drainage:** Consider using the planter shelf as a soil saver rather than a bottom tray. This can help create a space for excess water to drain away from the soil. Additionally, you might want to enlarge the existing drainage holes or add more holes to ensure water can escape more easily.\n\n2. **Check Soil Moisture:** Continue using the moisture meter, but also rely on the finger test for the top few inches of soil. If the top feels dry but the meter reads wet, it indicates that the bottom is still retaining too much moisture.\n\n3. **Adjust Watering Practices:** Since you've stopped watering, allow the soil to dry out more thoroughly before watering again. When you do water, ensure that excess water can drain away freely.\n\n4. **Monitor Plant Health:** Keep an eye on the plant's leaves and overall health. Removing dead leaves is a good practice, as it helps the plant focus its energy on healthy growth.\n\nBy addressing the drainage issue and adjusting your watering practices, your begonias should start to recover. If you notice any further issues, feel free to reach out for more advice.",

        "utterance": "Based on the symptoms you've described and the fact that the copper solution did not fully prevent the issue, it is possible that your plants are affected by cane blight, a common fungal disease in blackberries and raspberries. This disease can cause canes to split and die back, especially after fruiting. Since you have already applied copper, which is a preventive measure, you might consider using a fungicide specifically targeted for cane blight. Ensure that you follow the recommended application schedule, especially during the dormant season and before bud break. Additionally, maintaining good air circulation by pruning and removing any infected canes can help reduce the spread of the disease. It's also important to monitor your raspberry patch, as the disease can spread between closely planted berries. Regularly inspect for any signs of disease and remove affected parts promptly. If the problem persists, consulting with a local extension service for a more tailored approach might be beneficial.",

        "utterance": "Hi, Avery, based on the information provided and the images, it seems like your maple trees might be experiencing a combination of issues. The white bugs you mentioned could be aphids or another type of sap-sucking insect, which can cause white spots and stress to the leaves. However, the dieback of the lower branches is likely not caused by these insects alone. The presence of landscape fabric and rocks since 2006 could be contributing to poor soil aeration and water penetration, which can stress the tree over time. I recommend removing the fabric and rocks around the base of the tree to improve soil conditions. Additionally, ensure that the tree is not overwatered, as excessive moisture can lead to root rot and further stress. Consider consulting with a local arborist for a more detailed assessment and treatment plan. Thank you for reaching out, and I hope this helps your trees recover.",

Based on the symptoms you've described and the photos, it seems like your laurels might be suffering from a combination of drought stress and possibly a fungal infection, given the tiny black spots on the leaves. The recent increase in watering is a good step, but ensure that the soil is consistently moist but not waterlogged. You might want to check the soil moisture regularly to avoid overwatering. For the potential fungal issue, consider applying a fungicide that is safe for laurels, and ensure good air circulation around the plants to reduce humidity. Pruning out the affected branches can also help prevent the spread of any disease. If the problem persists, you might want to consult a local arborist or extension service for a more detailed analysis. I hope this helps, and I understand how disheartening it can be to see your hard work affected. Please let me know if you have any more questions.",

These pests can skeletonize leaves by eating the tissue between the veins. The black excrement you mentioned is often referred to as 'frass,' which is a common sign of caterpillar activity. To manage this problem, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. **Manual Removal**: Inspect your plants carefully, especially the undersides of leaves, for any caterpillars or beetles and remove them by hand.\n\n2. **Neem Oil**: Apply neem oil to the affected plants. It acts as a repellent and can disrupt the life cycle of many pests.\n\n3. **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)**: This is a natural bacterium that targets caterpillars specifically. It is safe for plants and beneficial insects but should be applied according to the instructions.\n\n4. **Encourage Natural Predators**: Attract birds or beneficial insects like ladybugs and lacewings to your garden, as they can help control pest populations.\n\n5. **Regular Monitoring**: Keep an eye on your plants regularly to catch any new infestations early.\n\nIf the problem persists, consider consulting with a local extension service or a professional for further advice.",

Now the leaves are all turning yellow as if it was already the fall.  And the top of the trunk is narrowing.  Is there anything I can do to save it?\nexpert: Unfortunately, the prognosis does not look\u00a0good. The gummosis (the jelly-like substance pushing out of the tree) is indicative of bark injury. This could include accidental mower/trimmer injury, disease or boring insects. The tree pushes out this sap to try and exclude invaders.\u00a0 In our area it is commonly related to the Peachtree borer, especially if you can see any sawdust-like frass stuck within it. Once they are within a tree there is not much you can do. Ornamental cherries tend to be relatively short-lived (compared to say, shade trees) and can start to decline at about 20 years, but you can generally enjoy them for as long as they are attractive to you.  Here is our page on Ornamental Cherries and their problems:\u00a0 https://extension.umd.edu/resource/ornamental-cherry-trees-identify-and-manage-problems/ It's possible that there could be a related canker disease at work\u00a0as well. Often you can extend the life of the tree a bit by reducing stress, like\u00a0keeping it watered in times of drought, and making sure that mulch is no deeper than 2-3 inches and kept pulled back from the trunk. However, last season we had prolonged periods of serious drought that stressed all of our trees and as we hit this period of high heat and lack of rain, some will not be able to survive. You could give it a good, slow, long drink but it may not make much difference at this point, I am sorry to say.  My much-beloved weeping cherry succumbed years ago but was in a place (back of my house outside a window near my birdfeeders) where I could leave it to naturally decline and die(usually limb by limb). Over many years it has served as food (woodpeckers, nuthatches and others hunt and eat insects under the bark, tree frogs have been found there too, and bluebirds and many others often perch there before feeding. (My point being, dead trees have a good deal of environmental value).   Christine\nuser: Hi, Avery,I should have mentioned that this is in our backyard and we have a healthy one in the front yard that was planted at the same time. \u00a0I am wondering if leaving it might be a danger to that tree or all the other trees in the back near it. \u00a0There is a well established lacy leaf Japanese maple about 30\u2019 from the weeping cherry and a new one about the same distance in a different direction.  Would it be a good idea to cut off all the gummosis on the trunk? \u00a0Would any kind of fertilizer help?

        "utterance": "Hi, Taylor, given the symptoms you've described and the presence of gummosis, it's likely that the weeping cherry is suffering from a disease or pest issue that could potentially spread to nearby trees, especially if they are susceptible to the same problems. However, the risk to the Japanese maple and other trees depends on the specific cause of the gummosis. If it's due to a pest like the Peachtree borer, it might not affect the maples, but if it's a fungal disease, there could be a risk. \n\nRemoving the gummosis won't solve the underlying problem, and cutting it off could further stress the tree. Fertilizer is unlikely to help if the tree is already in severe decline. \n\nTo protect your other trees, it might be wise to consult with a local arborist who can assess the situation in person and provide specific advice. They can help determine if removal is necessary and if any preventive measures should be taken for the other trees. \n\nIf you decide to remove the tree, ensure that the stump and roots are properly removed to prevent any potential disease from lingering in the soil.

Here are a few steps you can take to help them recover:\n\n1. **Check Planting Depth**: Ensure that the root flare (where the roots start to spread out from the trunk) is at or slightly above the soil level. If they are planted too deep, consider carefully replanting them at the correct depth.\n\n2. **Improve Drainage**: Since you mentioned heavy clay soil, ensure that water is not pooling around the roots. You might need to improve drainage by adding organic matter or creating a raised bed.\n\n3. **Watering**: Make sure you are watering appropriately. Cherry laurels prefer moist but well-drained soil. Avoid overwatering, especially if the soil is not draining well.\n\n4. **Mulching**: Apply a layer of mulch around the base of the plants to help retain moisture and regulate soil temperature, but keep it away from the trunk to prevent rot.\n\n5. **Fertilization**: If the plants are not showing signs of improvement, consider a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in the spring to give them a nutrient boost.\n\n6. **Pruning**: Remove any dead or diseased branches to encourage new growth and improve air circulation.\n\nIf these steps do not lead to improvement, it might be worth consulting with a local horticulturist or extension service for further advice specific to your area's conditions.",

        "utterance": "To manage the fruit fly larvae without using chemical sprays, you can employ several strategies. First, consider using physical barriers like fine mesh netting to prevent the flies from laying eggs on the cherries. This can be effective if applied before the flies become active. Additionally, you can use traps to monitor and reduce the adult fly population. Yellow sticky traps or homemade traps using apple cider vinegar can attract and capture the flies. It's also important to practice good sanitation by removing and disposing of any fallen or infested fruit to reduce the number of larvae that can overwinter. Regarding your questions about the spread, fruit flies can indeed travel between trees, and it's possible that your neighbors' trees are also affected. If you decide not to harvest the cherries, it could potentially increase the local population of the pest, as the larvae will have more opportunities to develop and spread. Collaborating with your neighbors to manage the pest collectively could be beneficial. Lastly, maintaining the trees for aesthetic purposes is fine, but regular monitoring and some level of management will help keep the infestation in check.",

        "utterance": "The symptoms you're describing, yellowing leaves with deep green veins, are indicative of chlorosis, which is often caused by nutrient deficiencies, particularly iron. Given the recent drought conditions, it's possible that the stress from lack of water has exacerbated the issue. Conducting a soil test is a great step to confirm if there are nutrient deficiencies. If the test indicates low iron levels, using a product like Iron Tone can help address the deficiency. SuperThrive is a supplement that can help reduce plant stress and promote growth, but it won't directly address nutrient deficiencies. \n\nFor your Kousa dogwood, since it is well-established, it is likely to recover with proper care, including addressing any nutrient deficiencies and ensuring adequate watering during dry periods. The deep watering you plan to do is beneficial, as it encourages deep root growth and helps the plant withstand dry spells. \n\nAs for the leucothoe, since it hasn't deteriorated further, continue monitoring it and ensure it receives adequate water and nutrients. If the soil test shows deficiencies, you can address them similarly. \n\nOverall, with the right care, both plants should be able to recover and thrive.",

        "utterance": "Based on the information provided, it seems likely that the browning leaf tips on your Cherokee Brave and Cherokee Princess Cornus Florida varieties could be due to environmental stress, such as leaf scorch, rather than a fungal pathogen. Leaf scorch can occur when the plant is unable to take up enough water to meet its needs, especially during hot and dry conditions. Although you are watering twice weekly, the hot temperatures may require more frequent or increased watering to prevent stress. Consider increasing the amount of water or the frequency of watering, especially during periods of high heat. Additionally, ensure that the soil is well-draining and that the roots are not waterlogged, as this can also cause stress. Continue to monitor the plants for any changes in symptoms, and adjust your care routine as needed. If symptoms persist or worsen, further investigation may be necessary.",

        "utterance": "It sounds like your plant is experiencing an infestation primarily of aphids, which are often accompanied by other insects like mites and caterpillars. The presence of winged insects could be adult aphids or beneficial insects like parasitic wasps. If you have noticed wasps, they might be natural predators helping to control the aphid population. Spraying with soapy water can be effective in reducing aphid numbers, but it might also disrupt the wasps. If the infestation isn't severe and the wasps are actively managing the aphids, you might choose to let nature take its course. However, if the infestation is damaging your plant significantly, a gentle spray with soapy water can help reduce the aphid population. Be sure to test the soapy water on a small part of the plant first to ensure it doesn't cause damage.",

        "utterance": "Based on your description and the symptoms you've observed, it does seem likely that your coneflowers are affected by aster yellows. This disease is caused by a phytoplasma and is spread by leafhoppers, which makes it challenging to control once it has spread in an area. Removing all infected plants is a prudent step to prevent further spread. For replacements, consider planting species that are not susceptible to aster yellows. Some good alternatives might include plants like black-eyed Susans (Rudbeckia), which are similar in appearance but generally more resistant to this disease. Additionally, maintaining good garden hygiene and monitoring for leafhoppers can help manage the spread of aster yellows in the future. Good luck with your new planting project!",

        "utterance": "The browning and curling of Rudbeckia leaves can be caused by several factors, including environmental stress, such as drought or excessive heat, nutrient deficiencies, or even chemical damage from nearby treatments. Since you've mentioned grasshoppers affecting your other plants, it's possible that stress from pest pressure could also be contributing indirectly. For the Rudbeckia, ensure they are receiving adequate water, especially during dry spells, and consider mulching to retain soil moisture. As for the grasshoppers, using a neem oil spray can act as a deterrent. Neem oil is a natural pesticide that can help manage grasshopper populations without harming beneficial insects. It is important to reapply neem oil after rain, as it can wash off. Always follow the instructions on the label for the best results.",

The installation of the gravel walkway could have affected the root zone, potentially stressing the tree and making it more susceptible to disease or pests.\n\nTo address this issue, I recommend the following steps:\n1. Inspect the tree closely for any signs of pests, such as small holes in the bark or sawdust-like material.\n2. Consider having a professional arborist assess the tree to determine if there is a fungal infection or pest problem.\n3. Ensure the tree is receiving adequate water, especially if the gravel walkway has altered the drainage pattern.\n4. Avoid any further disturbance to the root zone.\n5.

        "utterance": "Thank you for providing the additional details, Margaret. Given the information, it seems like the issue might be related to nutrient availability or root health. Since you've already added compost and a soil acidifier, it might be beneficial to conduct a soil test to check for nutrient deficiencies or pH imbalances. Chlorosis often indicates a lack of iron or other micronutrients, which can be affected by soil pH. Additionally, ensure that the hand watering is consistent and deep enough to reach the root zone, especially during dry spells. If the soil test reveals any deficiencies, you can amend the soil accordingly. Also, consider checking for any signs of root rot or pest issues that might not be immediately visible. If the problem persists, consulting with a local extension office or a professional arborist might provide more tailored solutions.",

Since you mentioned that new growth is coming from the main stems, you can leave a few inches of the main stems above the ground to support this new growth. As for repelling rabbits in future winters, consider using physical barriers like chicken wire or hardware cloth around the base of the bushes.

I am forwarding this to one of our entomologists. Thank you. Regards, Drew S MSU Ask Extension Administrator\nexpert: The pheromone traps will attract the moths, if present, but won't kill them. Since you have at least a few already in the closet, you're going to need to spend time thoroughly searching the area and other spaces around the home. I would recommend placing any susceptible clothing items in sealed totes or vacuum packs and then clean and vacuum more than usual over the coming weeks. Once you no longer see any clothes moths, it would be safe to return the clothes and other items to their former spots. If you find a garment that is affected by clothes moths, it should be laundered at a high temperature (but check label to see if it will be safe) to kill any larvae or eggs that could be on it.  The cedar blocks will be of limited value. For more information:\u00a0https://content.ces.ncsu.edu/clothes-moths-carpet-beetles-controlling-fabric-pests.

        "utterance": "Clothes moths primarily target natural fibers because they contain keratin, a protein that the larvae can digest. This includes wool, silk, cashmere, angora, and other animal-based fibers. While moths are less likely to damage synthetic fibers like polyester or nylon, they may still infest these materials if they are blended with natural fibers or if there are food stains or body oils present. Therefore, it's most important to focus on protecting items made from natural fibers, but also ensure that all clothing is clean and free from stains to minimize the risk of infestation.",

        "utterance": "Carpenter bees are indeed beneficial pollinators, but they can cause structural damage if left unchecked. Here are some steps you can take to manage them ecologically:\n\n1. **Plug Existing Holes**: Once you are sure the bees have left the nest (usually late summer or fall), you can plug the holes with caulk or wood putty. This will prevent them from reusing the same holes next year.\n\n2. **Provide Alternative Nesting Sites**: Placing soft wood like pine nearby can sometimes encourage them to nest there instead of your deck. However, this is not always guaranteed to work, as carpenter bees often prefer untreated wood.\n\n3. **Paint or Varnish the Deck**: Carpenter bees are less likely to drill into painted or varnished wood. Consider applying a fresh coat of paint or varnish to your deck to deter them.\n\n4. **Use Natural Repellents**: Citrus oil is a natural repellent for carpenter bees. You can spray a citrus oil solution around the areas where they are active.\n\n5. **Monitor and Maintain**: Regularly inspect your deck for new holes and take action as needed. Keeping the wood in good condition will also help deter them.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help protect your deck while minimizing harm to the bees.",

The presence of green shoots is a positive sign, indicating that the plants are still alive and may recover. As for the landscaping company, it is reasonable to expect them to assess the plants if they are under warranty.

Use clean, sharp pruning shears to cut them as close to the base as possible. Regularly check for new suckers and remove them promptly to maintain the health and shape of your Cleveland pear tree.",

        "utterance": "Thank you for providing the additional images, Jon. Based on the photos, it appears that the tomato plants are affected by Septoria leaf spot, which is common in humid conditions. To mitigate the issue this year, ensure that you remove and dispose of any infected leaves to prevent further spread. For next year, consider the following preventive measures: \n1. Rotate your crops to avoid planting tomatoes in the same spot each year.\n2. Use disease-resistant tomato varieties.\n3. Ensure proper spacing between plants to improve air circulation.\n4. Water the plants at the base rather than overhead to minimize leaf wetness.\n5. Apply a mulch layer to prevent soil from splashing onto the leaves.\n6. Regularly inspect plants for early signs of disease and remove affected leaves promptly.\nThese steps should help reduce the incidence of foliar diseases in the future. Feel free to share this information with the other gardeners. Have a great day!",

I went out to cut them off and much to my surprise I could pull the branches out without cutting them! The branches appear to have been cut at the trunk. They are not branches that were left by the pruners because I can pull the entire branch out of the tree. All of the branches have similar clean, grooved cuts at an angle. There are no tear marks, so I don't think these broke off over the winter (and they haven't been brown all spring). What can I do?\nexpert: Hi, Avery, Thank you for contacting the University of Vermont Master Garden Helpline and providing photos. What a surprise it must have been to be able to pull out the branches without any effort. This type of damage is common and is caused by a critter - most likely a rabbit. Voles can be eliminated since their gnaw marks are irregular and at various angles; deer damage has a rough or torn appearance; squirrels can snip off a branch but the cut is tattered; porcupines strip the bark. Rabbits on the other hand use their incisors to make the clean, diagonal 45 degree angle cut when clipping off older woody twigs. Most rabbit damage is close to the ground and is no higher than 2-3 feet above ground. In the winter, when food is limited, rabbits eat twigs and gnaw the bark of woody plants. Although cedars are not a favorite of rabbits, they will feed on any small tree or shrub when food is scarce. A photo with similar damage to yours: https://www.torontomastergardeners.ca/askagardener/small-cedar-hedge-shows-possible-winter-animal-damage/ Rabbits are active year-round during the day or night during summer or the warmer periods of the day during winter. You can identify the presence of rabbits by their tracks, pea-sized droppings, and markings. Tracks made by their hind feet are much longer than the front feet and are placed as pairs ahead of the slightly staggered front feet in the snow or soft earth.  The best overall strategy for protecting your shrubs from damage is to reduce areas of habitat by removing brush piles, tall dense grasses or stone piles. If the rabbits are abundant, you may consider fencing such as chicken wire fencing or hardware cloth. In many situations this is not possible so repellents may be an option. The following websites provide details: https://extension.umn.edu/planting-and-growing-guides/protecting-trees-and-shrubs-winter https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/help-for-the-home-gardener/advice-tips-resources/pests-and-problems/animals/rabbits  I hope this helps and happy gardening!\nuser: Thank you for your prompt response! There are several factors that I think rule out rabbits, plus some new information I just learned. The damage is on a very mature, dense hedge between two paved driveways (no piles of brush, tall grasses, etc). The damage is much higher than 2-3 feet off the ground. We have never seen any rabbits around here.Here are two more pictures and a new discovery. Notice the dead branches up high, about six feet off the ground. I took the picture and then pulled one of the branches and sure enough, it pulled right out.\u00a0 On further inspection I saw that the trunks of several of the cedars have been stripped of their bark!\u00a0 The second picture shows one of these. There are more that are stripped.\u00a0 Can this be a porcupine?\u00a0 I have never seen a porcupine around here (we live in an older, dense neighborhood of Montpelier near a big open field behind houses on the other side of a residential street), but I suppose that is possible.Thanks again for your help!PaulOn Thu, Jun 29, 2023 at 7:55\u202fAM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\n",

The bacterium can damage flowers, fruit, new shoots and older wood, even trunks and roots. Some cultivars are very susceptible to this disease. Fireblight appears to some degree every year. This year was not considered an especially bad year for it although the severity in a given orchard depends on wetaher conditions, variety susceptibility, growth stage (open blooms), etc. https://ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/plpath-fru-22-0 https://extension.umn.edu/plant-diseases/fire-blight https://extension.unh.edu/resource/fire-blight-fact-sheet  Prune out the affected plant parts during dry weather.

We got rid of the voles, and I\u00a0did some spot checks on the roots, which looked healthy. When the tree leafed out this year, the leaves were green and healthy, although there were fewer of them.

Here are a couple of other notes which may be helpful: In the past, I have not watered the tree during the summer; this summer I\u00a0have watered twice, hoping I might help it bounce back from anything the voles may have done that I didn't see - now I'm worried those two extra waterings have harmed the tree I fertilized the tree the first year, but not the second, and not this year One of our dogs started peeing in that area this April; we put a stop to that with the chicken wire you see in the photo, and the tree leafed out like normal in May  Thank you so very much for your time and assistance!\nexpert: Hi, Taylor,  First, resume regular watering - it's been so hot and this is still a very young tree. Second, remove all the grass below the tree and add a layer of wood mulch. Keep it a few inches away from the base of the tree. The grass is competing with the tree for water and resources. I\u00a0also have concerns the tree may be planted too deep. This is a grafted tree, so there will be a crook that should be above the ground - and then the roots would be a couple inches below the graft union. If it's planted too deep, then the roots are not at the soil surface and may not be getting adequate water.  If it is planted too deeply, you can dig it up and plant it properly.  But start by removing the grass and then checking the soil moisture. It's been so hot and all of our trees will need some supplemental water, even if they are mature. Younger trees will show signs of stress more quickly.  Let me know what you find!\nuser: Hi, Morgan, Thank you so much. I will get started on those steps right away. I should have mentioned that the tree does get watered by the sprinklers every other day. How often should I water in addition to that?\u00a0 Sent from my iPhone On Jul 4, 2024, at 9:19\u202fAM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:   \ufeff\n",

        "utterance": "To manage and prevent the spread of nimblewill, consider the following strategies: \n\n1. **Cultural Practices**: Maintain a healthy, dense lawn by mowing at the recommended height for your grass type, watering deeply but infrequently, and fertilizing appropriately. A healthy lawn can outcompete nimblewill and other weeds.\n\n2. **Physical Barriers**: While fencing is not an option, you might consider creating a physical barrier using a deep edging material that can help prevent the rhizomes from spreading into your yard.\n\n3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keep a close eye on the perimeter of your yard for any new nimblewill growth. Early detection and treatment can prevent larger infestations.\n\n4. **Chemical Control**: Continue using Tenacity as per the label instructions, but also consider rotating with other herbicides that are effective against nimblewill to prevent resistance. Consult with a local extension office for recommendations on alternative herbicides.\n\n5. **Community Approach**: Engage with your neighbors to manage nimblewill collectively. Sharing information and coordinating control measures can be more effective than individual efforts.\n\nBy combining these strategies, you can reduce the likelihood of nimblewill spreading into your yard from neighboring properties. If you need further assistance, consider reaching out to a local extension service for more tailored advice.",

In spring 2022 they had brown and dead looking lowermost branches which I had not been overly worried about.  I did not notice any major issues with them over the winter, but this spring several in the row were looking quite brown over their entire height.  Our tree care person said he did not see anything that looked like insect damage or other disease mechanism.  Rather, he attributed the browning to drought stress.  I have been giving them a deep watering once per week (what I believe to be 1\") in the hopes of seeing improvement.  I bought a soil moisture gauge and between waterings, it was still indicating the soil was staying moist (but not wet).  However, things not only have not gotten any better, they have gotten markedly worse.  More trees are browning and the browning is more severe.  It is particularly weird because a completely brown one will be next to a healthy looking green one. I am wondering if the brown ones are beyond hope and should be removed.  Is it worth replacing them or is this indicative that we should put a fence or a different type of bush in this location.

In the fall we noticed some of the boxwoods looked like they were not doing well compared to others.  All are big plants, likely many years old.  There has been no improvement this spring.  I'm wondering what the problem is and what to do about it.\nexpert: Hi, Skyler older boxwoods you could do a regeneration prune to thin out and remove some of the old dying growth to help regenerate some new growth and vigor. If they are been sheared in the past (it does look like it from these photos), it only stimulates the end growth of the plant and causes them to\u00a0develop thick outer growth , not allowing light and air movement to the inner branches which can cause die back and disease issues. The orange color is usually from winter damage and fluctuating winter temperatures. The branches with the straw color should be pruned out all together. You can explore our Identify common Boxwood problems webpage to see if you can explore other issues. There is also a link at the bottom of the page\u00a0for a YouTube video on the pruning techniques to help thin them out and get rid of the damaged stems. If there are any specific disease issues, proper pruning tends to be the best solution for maintenance anyways, unless you see other telltale symptoms.  Feel free to continue to\u00a0send photos or reach out with other questions.  Emily\nuser: Hi, Emerson\u2019s almost a year later now.\u00a0 The boxwood problem seems to me to be spreading to other boxwoods\u2026I probably have between 18 and 24 Boxwoods total.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering if there is someplace in the area where I could take or send more pictures of some of the yellowing or whitening vegetation.\u00a0 If it is the boxwood blight apparently the only thing to do it dig out every one that is yellowing.\u00a0 I\u2019d hate to lose them all but don\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0 I live in South Laurel.\u00a0  Thanks for your any help you can give me. John\nexpert: Hello, Jordan,  You are welcome to share photos here, in this discussion thread; while the system might limit you to three attachments per reply, you can reply more than once in order to send more pictures if needed.\u00a0If you prefer, you might be able to bring samples in to your local county Extension office, but reach out to them ahead of time to see if they can do such a diagnosis. (Sometimes, county offices just send the inquiry to us at Ask Extension if they don't have a horticulture specialist or plant pathologist on-site, since we at HGIC\u00a0are not based in a county office, but answer queries from around the state.)  One of the most common ailments we see on the myriad boxwood questions we're sent throughout the year\u00a0is the fungal disease Volutella Blight. Like many plant infections, its severity and spread can be weather-dependent, more severe in wet conditions when rains are regular or when plants are irrigated often (or with sprinklers that wet the foliage). Volutella is a comparatively weak pathogen, meaning that it largely takes advantage of struggling plants that are stressed from some other cause (like winter damage or over-pruning), and it tends not to cause damage on healthy plants. Since this fungus does not kill the roots, a drastic cut-back like Emily had mentioned is often the best recourse, especially since pruning out dying branches would otherwise leave a patchwork of unappealing scraggly stems. A photo example of a pruned-back boxwood shrub that has begun to regrow is attached, if helpful. Granted, given the slow growth rate of boxwoods, it will take a few years to regain its former size, but if the shrub is\u00a0not sheared in the meantime, it probably will be less vulnerable to future Volutella infections or other issues\u00a0because the foliage won't be as crowded.  Boxwood Leafminer is the other problem\u00a0we see very frequently, and high populations can cause a lot of foliage discoloration (turning orange-yellow), blistering,\u00a0and premature leaf shedding. If this pest is\u00a0present, the bright yellow-orange adult gnats will probably emerge fairly soon and hover over the plants.\u00a0(They don't bite.) On a quiet day in spring, you might even be able to hear the shrub rustling (like the subtle popping of wet Rice Krispies)\u00a0with the activity of the juveniles while they are still inside the leaves.\u00a0Heavy pruning, as for Volutella management, will also help remove the majority of these insects from an infested shrub. Some boxwood cultivars are more inherently susceptible to this insect than others. Some insecticides work well for management of this pest, but we generally discourage their use since they might impact beneficial insects.  Boxwood Blight is less likely if the ailing plants have discolored foliage like you describe, since usually an advanced stage of infection results in no foliage (they shed pretty quickly, sometimes while still mostly green) and a very bare, twiggy appearance, especially in large sections of the plant, or starting around their base. If it is present, then yes, replacement with non-boxwood alternatives is the most practical solution.  Miri\nuser: Thank you, Charlie, for your help.\u00a0 If you think it would be of any value, I\u2019d be happy to take two or three pictures and post them.\u00a0 John\n",

Based on the symptoms you've described and the images provided, it seems like the issue could be related to either Volutella Blight or Boxwood Leafminer, as these are common problems in boxwoods. Volutella Blight often affects plants that are already stressed, and pruning can help manage it by removing infected branches. Boxwood Leafminer can cause yellowing and blistering of leaves, and while pruning can help reduce their numbers, it's important to avoid using insecticides that might harm beneficial insects. If you suspect Boxwood Blight, which is less likely given the symptoms, it would be best to replace the affected plants with non-boxwood alternatives.

Bees are more likely to move if the new hive is in close proximity to their current location. You can also try to make the new hive more attractive by rubbing some beeswax inside it or using a swarm lure. However, moving the bees manually is often necessary, especially if the hive is exposed and at risk. Since you mentioned you don't have equipment, I recommend reaching out to local beekeeping associations or clubs in Yamhill or Washington County. They often have members who are willing to assist with such tasks. You might also find someone who can help identify the queen and safely transfer the combs. Good luck with your relocation efforts!",

Thank you!\nexpert: Dear, Charlie- Thanks so much for contacting us with your ground wasp question. You are quite right in thinking that many kinds of ground wasps are beneficial and can help us manage harmful insects in our gardens. That said, it does seem that you are dealing with a lot of ground wasps!\u00a0I am including links to two good sources- one has information about the best practices for getting rid of/managing your ground wasp population and the other has some interesting information about ground wasps- there's always something to learn!\u00a0 https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/getting_rid_of_wasps_nests https://extension.psu.edu/programs/master-gardener/counties/monroe/news/wasps-beneficial-insects-and-pollinators Good luck with your gardening. Best, Rachel (master gardener volunteer)\nexpert: Ruth, Following up on our conversation a few minutes ago, the application of diatomaceous earth to ground wasps nests has frequently been found to be effective (and if you can blow it in with a bellows, all the better). Also, depending your your degree of courage, you can try using a shop vac to vacuum out the nest...! Mint does seem to repel wasps, and you could use mint oil around the holes as well as plant mint. But planting is a more long-range solution for future years. Best of luck, RichardMGV\nuser: Hello, Reese,   Thank you for these articles.\u00a0 I believe I have Cicada Killers.\u00a0 They are about 2\" long.\u00a0 There are many, many but they don't hang out together.\u00a0 It looks like they each manage their own nest.\u00a0   I've been using my push mower over their nests.\u00a0 They come out and act a little threatening but they seem to let me mow.\u00a0 They mostly come out later in the morning when it's sunny, so I can try to figure out a schedule to not bother them.\u00a0 I even watched one up close as it dug a hole.\u00a0 Very interesting!\u00a0 I don't want to use insecticides.

        "utterance": "Hello, Charlie, Cicada Killers are indeed fascinating creatures, and it's great that you're observing them closely. Since you prefer not to use insecticides, using mint as a deterrent is a good natural approach. Planting mint under your hedges or sprinkling mint leaves around the grass could help, as mint is known to repel various insects. However, keep in mind that Cicada Killers are generally not aggressive and are beneficial for controlling cicada populations. If they are not causing significant issues, it might be best to coexist with them, especially since they are solitary and less likely to swarm. Applying diatomaceous earth to nests near areas where you frequently work is a good strategy to manage their population without harming them. Best of luck with your garden, and feel free to reach out if you have more questions! Best, Rachel",

        "utterance": "To differentiate between milkweed assassin nymphs and leaf-footed bugs, you can look for a few key characteristics. Milkweed assassin nymphs are typically bright orange or red with black legs and antennae, and they have a more slender body. Leaf-footed bugs, on the other hand, have a more robust body and are usually brown with a distinctive leaf-like structure on their hind legs. If you determine that the bugs are indeed leaf-footed bugs, the mixture of water, neem oil, and peppermint oil can be an effective treatment. Apply it directly to the bugs, focusing on the undersides of leaves where they might be hiding. Regular monitoring and manual removal can also help manage their population.

        "utterance": "It seems likely that the symptoms your Chinkapin Oak is experiencing could be related to herbicide drift, especially given the proximity of the 2,4-D and VISTA applications. Even with minimal wind, these chemicals can volatilize and affect nearby plants, causing symptoms like leaf curling and leathery texture. To mitigate this, try to avoid spraying on warmer days and consider using physical barriers or shields when applying herbicides near sensitive plants. Additionally, ensure the tree is receiving adequate water, especially during dry spells, as water stress can exacerbate herbicide damage.

Last March our landscape maintenance contractor applied the pre-emergent herbicide Pendulum to our stone borders and gardens, but not the lawn. The application turned everything, plants, rock, statuary, bird baths, etc bright yellow. Within about a week many plants were obviously starting to die at all 25 units. The plants affected included ajuga, miniature roses, hydrangea, spiral grass, and virtually all of the ground cover type plants. The landscape contractor said not to worry as all the plants will come back in a few weeks and the yellow will quickly fade with some rain. The ajuga, miniature roses, hydrangea, daisies and many other garden plants and most of the ground cover type plants actually died. Some ornamental grasses, lilies, bleeding hearts, burning bush and a few others either weren\u2019t affected or recovered. The landscape contractor has continued to insist that it wasn\u2019t the Pendulum product but something else that caused the die off. Any insight you can give me on this situation and the effects of the Prelude product, especially if applied incorrectly would be appreciated. Roger Ulane, Country Lake Villa HOA President\nexpert: Hi, Riley,  I agree with your landscape contractor that these plants were not affected by the Pendulum (pendimethalin). This is a preemergence product and will\u00a0only affect germinating seedling plants - not those that are established.  A couple questions:  1. Are these photos recent? 2. Did anyone else do weed control in the landscape beds or has your contractor sprayed anything else? (Also consider a \"helpful\" neighbor) 3. Do you have photos following the March application of the yellowing?  Pendimethalin is primarily used a grassy preemergence control product, for crabgrass and other annual grasses. It has limited effectiveness on broadleaf annuals. But it would not harm established perennials and woody plants.\u00a0  The photos you sent look like a non-selective herbicide was applied in the landscape beds.\nuser: Alison O'Connor, PhD, \u00a0 The photos were taken yesterday.\u00a0 No one else applied any type of product to the affected areas.\u00a0 The gardens and rock borders with plants were affected at all 25 units.\u00a0 The attached pictures were taken today showing the yellow sludge that is still present approximately four months after application.

We usually need a picture of the whole plant, a branch clearly showing leaves and buds, and then a picture showing any fruit or flowers to I.D. A plant. But, assuming all 3 pictures are of plants in bloom right now,\u00a0these 3 appear to be as follows: Your first picture is forsythia (Forsythia species).

If you prune too late after its blooms fall, then you may prune off next year\u2019s flower buds.This shrub also is a good indicator of, when it is in bloom, it is time to apply crabgrass pre-emergent on your lawn, if needed.

Please attach a picture of the tree these flowers are from so I can confirm that it is a cherry. (one to show the whole tree, and the bark ) If it is, then you will likely need a spray schedule to protect fruits from insects and fungi. You may also need to erect a bird net to keep some fruit for yourself. Here is more on fruit tree care, with a section on cherries: Midwest backyard fruit care guide: https://plantpathology.ca.uky.edu/files/mw_home_fruit_productn_b591.pdf Pests, spray schedule: https://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/id/id-146-w.pdf The last picture is flowering quince, Chaenomeles species, not to be confused with common quince, Cydonia species.\u00a0It does occasionally set fruit, which is edible, but mostly used to make jellies and jams because of its high pectin content;\u00a0it has little flavor. Here is more on ornamental quince: https://ipm.missouri.edu/MEG/2018/9/quince/ And how to tell flowering from common quince: https://ipm.missouri.edu/MEG/2018/9/quince/ A good rule to follow for any shrub you are not growing for fruit, is to prune it after flowers fade, and to not prune off any more than 1/3 of the total crown in one season. As always, never use a garden chemical on edible fruit plants that is not labeled for use on that particular\u00a0edible fruit.

        "utterance": "Based on your description and the fact that the cherries turn red and have a clear interior, it is possible that your tree is a sweet cherry variety, especially since the birds and squirrels are more attracted to it compared to your tart cherry tree. Sweet cherries are generally more appealing to wildlife. To confirm, you could taste the cherries once they ripen fully on the tree. For care, ensure you have a proper spray schedule to protect the cherries from pests and diseases, and consider using bird netting to protect the fruit. Pruning should be done in late winter or early spring before the tree starts to bud.

If you want to maintain the specific variety of apple tree you originally purchased, it might be best to replace the tree. If you decide to keep the new growth, ensure it's healthy and not from a rootstock that might not produce desirable fruit. You can cut off the dead top to focus the tree's energy on the new growth.

        "decision": "<Respond>",
        "utterance": "Based on the information provided, the dead patches in your lawn could be due to several factors. Given that you have been treating for grubs regularly and have not observed them directly, it might be worth considering other potential causes. The full sun exposure and the watering schedule during your vacation might have contributed to heat stress, especially if the sprinkler system was not adjusted for hotter weather. Additionally, the lack of aeration since 2021 could be affecting soil compaction and root health. I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. **Aeration**: Consider aerating your lawn to improve soil compaction and root growth.\n2. **Watering**: Adjust your watering schedule to ensure deeper, less frequent watering, which encourages deeper root growth. During hot months, increase watering frequency if necessary.\n3. **Soil Analysis**: Conduct a soil test to check for nutrient deficiencies or pH imbalances that might be affecting grass health.\n4. **Grass Type**: Confirm the type of grass in your sod, as different grasses have varying tolerances to heat and drought.\n\nThese steps should help in diagnosing and remedying the issue with your lawn. If the problem persists, consider consulting a local lawn care expert who can assess the situation in person.",

Since oak wilt can spread through root grafts and beetles, removing the affected tree is a good step.

Additionally, avoid pruning or wounding other oak trees during the growing season when beetles are active, as this can increase the risk of infection.

However, a few days later I observed that some of the stems started \"wilting\" and then turning brown, plus a couple of the buds didn't open. I've continued to lose stems due to wilting over this past week. I'm concerned that this might be a type of peony blight but want to make sure before treating it. I was only able to attach 3 images but can send additional photos if needed.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n- What is causing the wilting and the blossoms to die before opening?\r\n- If this is a type of peony blight, how can I best manage the problem, and/or what can I use to treat the plant?\r\n- Is fern leaf peony foliage delicate such that I should minimize spraying with fungicides?\nexpert: I don't see anything that indicates Verticillium Wilt. Wilting can be caused by many factors like overwatering. excessive heat, or overfertilization. Here are some references for non-cultural problems:  Peony Problems (missouribotanicalgarden.org\u00a0and 01153.pdf;sequence=1 (umn.edu)  The buds not opening are most likely caused by Botrytis Blight. Here is a reference for you: Bud-blast of Peony (missouribotanicalgarden.org)  It is very important to note that fall clean up of peonies\u00a0is very important because any fungal infection winters over in the dropped leaves. Be sure you clean up all the stems and leaves of the plant in the fall and destroy them. Don't put them in your compost pile.  It will be OK to use a fungicide on the peony.\u00a0\u00a0Be advised that fungicides are preventative, not\u00a0curative. This means that the fungicides will protect the peony stems/leaves/buds that are not infected, but will not cure any part of the plant that is infected. You should just remove infected parts.\nuser: Hello again, I was very diligent about caring for my fern leaf peony this season. I sprayed the plant and surrounding soil with a fungicide to try and control what I assumed to be Botrytis Blight every 10 -14 days, was careful about watering, did not fertilize since the plant was obviously stressed, and removed all dead/dying foliage as it appeared. I even performed some soil improvements (well away from the roots) by adding sand plus additional compost and made sure that the ground was sloped away from the plant to improve drainage. Unfortunately, stems have slowly been dying off and there is not much left of what used to be a very healthy looking plant. I have large perennial garden with other healthy peony plants growing within a few feet of my fern peony, so I really don't know what went wrong. If you could help by answering a few follow-up questions I would really appreciate it.  Follow-up questions: Is there anything else you can think of that may have caused the decline of this plant? If this plant survives until fall, is there anything I can do to help it survive the winter other than clean up around the plant? Should I consider moving this peony to a different area in my garden yet this fall where it might receive a bit more sunshine? Note: I've read that transplanting fern leaf peonies is difficult, although mine was gorgeous when it came up this spring (planted in the fall of 2022).   Enclosed are photos of my peony from early this spring, and then again today. Thanks in advance for your help! -Robin     On 6/11/2023 11:21 AM, Ask Extension wrote:\n",

        "utterance": "Given the detailed care you've provided and the environmental conditions, it's possible that the fern leaf peony is experiencing stress from factors that are not immediately apparent, such as root issues or a hidden pest problem. Since you've already improved drainage and applied fungicides, consider checking for any signs of root rot or pest infestation. If the plant survives until fall, ensure a thorough cleanup of any fallen leaves and debris to prevent overwintering of any pathogens. Transplanting to a sunnier location could be beneficial, but be cautious as fern leaf peonies can be sensitive to transplanting. If you decide to move it, do so with care, ensuring minimal root disturbance.

Lichens on oak trees are pretty familiar and generally harmless.\u00a0 Here are some key points from educational sources:  Nature of Lichens: Lichens have a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi. They are not parasitic and do not harm the trees they grow on.  Impact on Trees: Lichens attach to the outer bark and do not penetrate deeply enough to cause damage. They can grow on both healthy and stressed trees.  Indicators of Air Quality: The presence of lichens, which are sensitive to pollution, can indicate good air quality.  Management: There is no need to remove lichens from trees. Instead, focus on tree health through proper watering, fertilization, and care.

We seeded the area last fall with the northwest meadow scape seed mix after 6 months of solarization with black plastic, and it looked terrific this spring and early summer. Despite the recommended watering, it now looks very dry, with a pretty thick mat of vegetation over most of the area. I assume some of this is just natural plant cycles and the result of the heat rather than something pathogenic, but am not sure.\r\n   We are getting mixed messages about what, if anything, to do to prepare for fall/winter. Should we cut this down or mow it, or just let it be? We want to be attentive to overwintering pollinators, but we also want to make sure seeds/reseeds have their best chance for success. Thanks for your advice!\nexpert: You are at the front of a curve of people learning to establish urban meadows.\u00a0There are challenges, and one is an idea that it can be hands-off for homeowners. It will take regular seasonal maintenance. I will share some publications for you to research further, making a plan for weeding, mowing, and reseeding. When to mow isn\u2019t an easy answer, but generally do it when the plants you want to seed have done so. Check their seed pods, as I think most desirable annuals have finished their lifecycle, so you can mow now. An added advantage can be reducing wildfire fuel from taller grasses. We have very dry summers, so part of the meadow cycle is late-summer dormancy. It is due more to natural cycles\u00a0than the amounts of water you provide. Read\u00a0this Meadowscaping Handbook. There are many details included. The end section on maintenance references mowing, and also\u00a0choosing which plants to allow to set seed. I found\u00a0this webinar video\u00a0from WSU Clark County, and think it applies for your meadow, at least in some ways. My last advice is to find meadows to visit in various times of the year, so you can compare with yours. I think contacting the West and East Multnomah Soil and Water Conservation Districts is a way to find where there are meadows you can see. Oh, my real last advice is to water your landscape trees, even conifers.\u00a0Here\u00a0is a publication from the Oregon Department of Forestry about watering landscape trees.\nuser: Thank you for your response. I have found that your recommendations have answered some of my questions. I have the Meadowscaping Handbook, but haven\u2019t found it specific enough for many of my questions.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We have decided to mulch/mow the meadow (so far have just trimmed off the taller plants), but the base seems to have a lot of ground cover from the lower-growing plants like self-heal, farewell to spring, meadow foam, dead nettle and clover, plus other flora we haven\u2019t been able to identify. Would raking be helpful or a hindrance? We want to have an area that will overwinter pollinators, but I\u2019m concerned that once the rain comes we\u2019ll have a thick slimey mat that will suppress future growth.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I think we are watering the trees sufficiently, if my calculations are correct, but I appreciate the handout as a useful reminder.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There are a couple of places over in Vancouver that I think we will visit to see if they have any suggestions.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sent from my iPad On Jul 31, 2024, at 14:42, Ask Extension wrote:\ufeff\nexpert: I was just in a training session today about eco-lawns, which isn't the same as what you are dealing with because they are kept mowed short, but it is clear that there isn't firm science-based literature answering your question about raking. I'll take a stab with some more information to help you decide. If the plants are perennial, they will\u00a0likely start to grow some this fall with rains and longer nights. Those plants won't be slimy. They will inhibit seeds sprouting. That's a good thing if the seeds are highly vigorous plants that will out-compete others in your mix. But not so great for your desired seeds. Raking out dead foliage will create more places for seed/soil contact, so again there's that seed sprouting issue: to encourage or not? How many insects are overwintering in your matted foliage? Do you have specific ones you are interested in tracking? Things like native bees tend to be in the soil or in shrub stems, so raking should be okay. You can look up the life cycle of those you are most interested in, to see where to look for evidence. I have a friend saving certain stems to be available to bees. Beetles and snails and slugs and earwigs are common in undisturbed garden litter. Greater yellow underwing larva are common in my garden, but that's not a native, and another common name is \"climbing cutworm\" so it eats too many of my flowers so I don't save those when I find them. Another thing that happens is that a few strong plants will overtake the others, leaving a limited population within only a year or two. Regular re-seeding with desired plants after weeding out others is a strategy some folks end up doing. In my class, participants were more likely to have given up after a couple of years and grow a different type of landscape instead of maintaining the eco-lawn. Another gardener is going to stick with it, but will water more often to give plants a longer season of bloom. The challenge is real. I searched \"meadow garden extension plant succession\" to see if one publication really jumped out as appropriate for you. They all look interesting, but there's not an obvious one from the PNW. I hope you'll check out\u00a0a few articles to see what I mean about how the plants compete and change. If this was my experiment, I would rake half and keep notes about what happens. I'm in Washington County, and two places with non-watered open areas to visit are the Tualatin River\u00a0National Wildlife Refuge and\u00a0Cooper Mountain Nature Park. Are you willing to let me copy your photos to share with other Master Gardeners? You have a fantastic experiment underway.\nuser: Jackie, thanks for the expansion on my question and the very useful detail you provided. Now that I understand better just how much of an experiment this is, we\u2019ve decided to try a few things. We\u2019ve divided the space up into three zones (there are probably more than that, but we\u2019ll start here). Zone 3 was just cut back to eliminate the tallest growth and we will leave it and observe. Zone 2 we mow/mulched at a high setting with the mulching mower, thus chopping up some of the thatch, and will observe. Zone 1 we mulch/mowed and then raked. We tried to hand-pull the thatch and it came up so easily that it left bare soil patches. This makes me think that perhaps we didn\u2019t have as big a problem with recurring lawn grass as I thought, so I feel more comfortable leaving that thatch. We\u2019re not going to seed the few open soil patches immediately, because we\u2019re not sure what is currently in that soil. I\u2019m still trying to identify a lot of the plants that came up. Likewise, I don\u2019t have any particular pollinators that I\u2019m following; just trying to see what shows up. One of my original sources recommended putting down slug inhibitor when we seeded last fall, and I didn\u2019t really see any evidence of slug activity. I can happily live without them! I like the idea of more frequent watering and will try that. It got so dry so fast this spring that I feel some later plants didn\u2019t get their chance. We had several kinds of lupine for example that grew well but never bloomed. I also look forward to checking out the two park/preserves you suggested. I will also try to send some photos.

But you do\u00a0have a Red Maple, Red maples, like other maple species, can face various problems that affect their health and appearance. In Michigan, some of the common issues that red maples may encounter include:1. Anthracnose: This disease primarily affects the leaves, causing irregular tan, brown, or reddish-brown blotches along the leaf veins or on the leaf margins. It can lead to leaf drop and unsightly leaves, but it rarely causes permanent damage.2. Chlorosis: This condition is characterized by leaves that are light green or yellow, often with dark green veins. It is usually caused by a nutrient deficiency, particularly a lack of manganese in the soil.3. Wood-boring insects: These pests, such as the flatheaded appletree borer, can cause significant damage by tunneling and feeding under the bark in living wood, leading to girdling, branch dieback, and structural weakness.4. *Verticillium wilt: This soil-borne fungus can enter the roots through wounds or when plants are weakened by stressors like drought. It can lead to branch dieback and is not controlled by fungicides but by plant care, such as watering during droughts and fertilization in the spring. 5. Leafminers: These pests can cause damage to the leaves, although the symptoms are not described in the provided references. The best way to learn what is causing the problem is to submit a sample and picture to the MSU Extension Plant and Pests Diagnostic Lab. To learn how to submit a sample go to: https://www.canr.msu.edu/pestid/You can also consult a certified arborist to assess the tree.

        "utterance": "Thank you for providing the additional information and pictures. Based on what you've shared, it seems like the fluctuating spring weather may have stressed your Acer maple, especially since the buds were nipped. This can lead to reduced vigor and poor appearance throughout the season. The fact that the identical tree in full sun is doing well suggests that the amount of sunlight might be a factor, as more sun can help trees recover from stress more effectively. Additionally, while sandy soil provides good drainage, it can also lead to nutrient leaching, which might contribute to issues like chlorosis if nutrients are not replenished. I recommend ensuring that your tree is receiving adequate nutrients, possibly through a balanced fertilizer, and monitoring it for any signs of pests or diseases.

        "utterance": "Based on your description, it sounds like your hostas are being affected by a pest infestation, possibly aphids or another small insect. Here are some steps you can take to manage the issue this fall and prevent it next year:\n\n1. **Immediate Management:**\n   - **Remove Affected Stems:** Cut and dispose of any heavily infested stems to reduce the pest population.\n   - **Insecticidal Soap:** Apply insecticidal soap or neem oil to the affected areas. These are effective against soft-bodied insects like aphids.\n   - **Water Spray:** Use a strong jet of water to dislodge insects from the plants.\n\n2. **Prevention for Next Year:**\n   - **Regular Monitoring:** Check your plants regularly for early signs of infestation.\n   - **Encourage Beneficial Insects:** Ladybugs and lacewings are natural predators of aphids. You can attract them by planting flowers like dill, fennel, or yarrow nearby.\n   - **Healthy Plant Practices:** Ensure your hostas are healthy by providing adequate water and nutrients, as healthy plants are more resistant to pests.\n   - **Mulching:** Apply mulch around the base of the plants to retain moisture and prevent weeds, which can harbor pests.\n\nIf the problem persists or if you're unsure about the pest identification, consider consulting a local extension service or a professional for a more tailored solution. The images you provided can also be helpful for a more accurate diagnosis.",

This could be caused by root damage or possibly by the honeylocust spider mite (or perhaps also the honeylocust right mite).\u00a0 During heavy mite infestations, large portions of the crown may turn off-yellow and the leaves will drop prematurely.\u00a0 Mites are usually problematic for trees in dry sites; if the tree is getting water from turfgrass they are less likely to be the culprit.\u00a0 If you are able to look closely at the yellowing leaves you can check for the presence of the mites, which are light green/yellowish, and quite small.\u00a0\u00a0 Root damage may have been caused by under- or over-watering, though if this is the first year for damage and your watering practices have not changed, this seems unlikely as well.

Here are some recommendations based on your questions:\n\n1. **Disposal of Tree Remnants**: It is generally a good idea to properly dispose of the remnants of a diseased tree to prevent the spread of pathogens. Burning the remnants can be an effective way to ensure that any bacteria or fungi are destroyed. However, check with local regulations regarding burning plant material.\n\n2. **Impact on Birds and Timing**: The berries themselves are unlikely to harm the birds, but if the tree is severely diseased, it might be best to remove it sooner rather than later to prevent any potential spread of disease to other trees. If you decide to leave the tree up for the birds, monitor the health of your other trees closely.\n\n3. **Replanting in the Same Spot**: Before planting a new tree in the same location, it is advisable to remove as much of the old root system as possible and consider treating the soil to ensure it is free of pathogens. You might also want to choose a tree species that is resistant to the disease that affected your ash tree.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance with your Dwarf Alberta Spruces, feel free to ask!",

        "utterance": "Based on the information provided, there are a few potential factors that could be contributing to the die-back of your 'Campbell' bamboo. Firstly, while you are watering regularly, it's possible that the bamboo is not receiving enough water, especially during the dry months. Bamboo requires consistent moisture, and the rocky, well-draining soil may be causing water to drain away too quickly. Consider increasing the frequency or amount of watering to ensure the soil remains consistently moist. Additionally, the presence of Japanese Cedars nearby could be competing for water and nutrients, which might affect the bamboo's health. It might be beneficial to apply a balanced fertilizer to provide additional nutrients, as the last application was in early 2022. Lastly, inspect the bamboo for any signs of pests or diseases, as these can also cause die-back. If the problem persists, consulting with a local expert or extension service for an on-site evaluation might provide further insights.",

The small white cottony areas on the trunk are characteristic of this pest. The black discoloration on the branches is likely sooty mold, which grows on the honeydew excreted by the scale insects. This mold can cover branches and leaves, but it doesn't directly harm the plant; however, it can block sunlight if it becomes extensive. The presence of dead branches could be due to the scale infestation weakening the plant. \n\nTo manage crepemyrtle bark scale, you can start by physically removing the scale insects with a soft brush or cloth. Applying horticultural oil can help suffocate the scales. It's best to apply it during the dormant season or when temperatures are cooler to avoid damaging the plant. Additionally, systemic insecticides can be effective, but they should be used with caution and according to label instructions. Regular monitoring and early intervention are key to managing this pest.

I planned to get them in the ground this Fall and I wonder if I shouldn\u2019t plant them or if it\u2019s OK. Thanks for any insights!\nexpert: You are correct. Black Vine Weevils. The adults notch the leaves, the larvae feed on the roots. The following information is from The Missouri Botanical Garden. The black vine weevil, Otiorhynchus sulcatus, also known as the taxus weevil, feeds on a wide range of ornamental plants but is most destructive in its larval stage to yew, hemlock, rhododendron, and several other broad-leaved evergreens as well as to some greenhouse plants such as asters, cyclamens, and impatiens. As an adult, it has a wide host range to include both deciduous and herbaceous plants. It is the most devastating of the root weevils throughout the northern half of the U.S. and Canada. Symptoms and Diagnosis Adult black vine weevil injury on broad-leaved evergreens and other hosts consists of marginal notching of the leaves. To detect weevil infestations on yew, examine the center of the plant near the main stems for notched and cut-off leaves. This damage is the result of adults feeding at night. The adult is 3/8 to 1/2 inches long, shiny, black, female, and cannot fly. It feeds only at night, and when disturbed, drops to the ground where it is virtually undetectable due to its coloration. Adult feeding rarely causes serious plant injury, however, the characteristic notches provide evidence that the pest is present and action is necessary to mitigate damage by the larva of the next generation. The larva causes the most damage by feeding on the roots and girdling the lower stems, disrupting the flow of nutrients and water through the plant. Its feeding may result in the death of the plant. The larvae are legless, C-shaped, and white with reddish-brown heads. They may be found at a depth of from 3/4 to 16 inches in the soil around the roots. Pupation occurs in the soil near the surface. Pupae are white with very prominent legs and antennae. Life Cycle Partially grown larvae overwinter in the soil. Adults emerge from the soil in late spring and egg-laying begins one to two weeks later. The female lays up to 500 eggs in the soil near the base of the plant over a period of two to three weeks. Larval feeding takes place from midsummer, when the eggs hatch, continues into the fall, and then again in the spring. Occasionally adults overwinter, which complicates the life cycle because eggs are laid earlier. There is usually one generation per year. The most vulnerable stage is the adult. The larvae are much less vulnerable because they are protected by the soil. Integrated Pest Management Strategies 1. Nematodes can be applied as a soil drench to control larval stages of black vine weevil. Several species have been reported to be effective. The nematodes kill by entering the victim's body and reproducing. Two species are commercially available: Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis heliothidis. H. heliothidis has been shown to be more effective against the early stages of the weevil at greater soil depths than S. carpocapsae. Nematodes can last three months in the soil, but soil temperature must be above 50 degrees F and the soil must be kept moist for nematode survival. Unfortunately, drenches are less effective under field conditions than in a greenhouse situation.

        "utterance": "Yes, it is advisable to treat your potted shrubs for root weevils before planting them in the ground. Since the larvae can cause significant damage to the roots, applying a treatment such as nematodes can help control the larval stages. Ensure that the soil temperature is above 50 degrees F and keep the soil moist for the nematodes to be effective. This proactive approach can help protect your plants from potential damage once they are in the ground.",

        "utterance": "Thank you for providing the additional images, Jon. Based on the close-up photos of the leaves, it appears that the tomato plants are affected by Septoria leaf spot, which is common in humid conditions and can be exacerbated by overhead watering. To mitigate the issue this year, continue to remove and dispose of any infected leaves to reduce the spread of the disease. For prevention next year, consider the following steps: \n\n1. Rotate your crops and avoid planting tomatoes in the same spot each year to reduce the buildup of pathogens in the soil.\n2. Use disease-resistant tomato varieties if available.\n3. Ensure proper spacing between plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the foliage.\n4. Water the plants at the base rather than overhead to keep the leaves dry.\n5. Apply a mulch layer to prevent soil from splashing onto the leaves, which can spread the disease.\n6. Regularly inspect plants for early signs of disease and remove affected leaves promptly.\n\nImplementing these practices should help reduce the incidence of foliar diseases in your community garden next season.

HELP!!!\u00a0 We're in a bit of a panic.\nexpert: Hi, Harper, I think there might be more than one thing going on with the tree.\u00a0 The sticky substance is caused by a sap-sucking insect. Inspect the leaves and the twigs looking for aphids, which are tiny, light green insects, that will be feeding on the underside of leaves along the veins or at the base of the petiole, which is the stem of the leaf. Aphids can be dislodged with a spray of water from the hose. Chemicals are generally not warranted or recommended because aphids have so many natural predators that would also be affected by a chemical application.\u00a0 The tree may need water if you do not have a sprinkler system for the lawn. Watering yard trees once a week in the absence of rain is always a good practice to prevent drought stress. Water using a sprinkler to thoroughly soak the entire area under the branches while being careful to avoid directly and repeatedly\u00a0spraying the trunk.\u00a0  The light yellow dots may be the return of the leaf spot you mentioned, which could actually be caused by eyespot gall midge?\u00a0Could have been the spots you saw last year. Scroll down to eyespot gall to find images for comparison.\u00a0 https://extension.psu.edu/leaf-galls-on-maple  https://content.ces.ncsu.edu/maple-eyespot-gall-midge-acericecis-ocellaris-osten-sacken-diptera-cecidomyiidae Control of galls, or the midges that cause galls, as the tree is not damaged by their presence.\u00a0  Are the dead branches at the top of the outside of the canopy, or crown of leaves?\u00a0If not, and it's a few interior branches that have died off,\u00a0then it's likely normal branch dieback. This occurs as some branches before shaded by outer leaves.\u00a0\u00a0 If the dead branches are on the outside at the top of the canopy, then something else might be going on.\u00a0  You can certainly contact an arborist to come out to evaluate the tree.

First, continue with the dislodgement method by regularly pulling out the seedlings by hand or using a hoe to cut them at the soil level. This is most effective when the seedlings are young and before they establish a strong root system. Additionally, applying a thick layer of mulch around your desired plants can help suppress the growth of new seedlings by blocking sunlight and making it harder for them to establish. You might also consider using landscape fabric under the mulch for added protection. Regular monitoring and maintenance will be key to keeping the birch seedlings under control. If the problem persists, you might want to explore more permanent solutions like installing a physical barrier or adjusting the garden layout to minimize seed fall in critical areas.",

        "utterance": "For your swamp azalea, it's generally best to prune in late winter or early spring before new growth begins. However, since you're dealing with a stressed plant, you might consider a light pruning now to remove any clearly dead or damaged wood, which can help the plant focus its energy on recovery. Avoid heavy pruning in the fall, as this can stimulate new growth that might not harden off before winter, potentially causing more stress. Continue to monitor the soil moisture and keep it consistently moist but not waterlogged. This care will give your azalea the best chance to recover and thrive next year.",

        "utterance": "Hi, Elliot,\n\nYour understanding of treating black spot disease on roses is mostly correct. Pruning back to healthy tissue is a common method, but removing the entire plant is usually a last resort. If the black spots are extensive and reach the base of the canes, it might be necessary to remove the plant to prevent further spread. However, if there are any canes with healthy tissue, you might try cutting back to those first.\n\nFor prevention, in addition to the methods you've mentioned, you can also apply a fungicide specifically designed for black spot. Ensure good air circulation around the plants by spacing them properly and removing any fallen leaves or debris that can harbor the fungus.\n\nRegarding your question about the pathogen spreading, yes, black spot can spread to other roses and potentially other susceptible plants in the vicinity. It's important to monitor nearby plants and take preventive measures to control the spread.\n\nI hope this helps, and feel free to reach out if you have more questions!\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",

Mulberry trees can produce a lot of fruit, especially after a storm, which might explain the sudden appearance of these objects. They are not harmful, and you can simply sweep them away. If you are concerned about the number of fruits falling, you might consider pruning the tree to manage its size and fruit production.

Before deciding to replant, consider improving the soil drainage in the current location by adding organic matter or creating a raised bed. If you decide to plant a new Baptisia, ensure it is in a spot with good drainage and consider providing some temporary shade during the hottest part of the day until it establishes.

        "utterance": "Based on your description and the symptoms you've observed, it does sound like your magnolia tree is infested with scale insects. The white fuzzy growth and the presence of sap are common indicators of scale. Treatment for scale insects typically involves applying horticultural oil or insecticidal soap, which can be effective in controlling the population. It's best to treat during the dormant season or when the scales are in their crawler stage, which is usually in late spring or early summer. However, given your concern about the tree's health and its proximity to your house, it might be wise to consult with a local arborist or pest control professional to assess the situation and determine the best course of action. They can also help you decide whether immediate treatment is necessary or if it can wait until the optimal treatment time.

But yesterday one of our dogs was stung once and when I went to find out what was going on I saw a large number of hornets, gotstung myself, and saw that both dogs were being stung.\r\nWe kennel our three dogs at least once every week or so meaning I need to be rid of this thing soon.  Having the hornets just leave would be ok as well as just destroying it/them. \r\nIf I've not identified the insects correctly please correct that.\r\nPictures attached.\nexpert: I am so sorry to hear about your dog. Yes, these nests can build for month before they are noticed.\u00a0  A few things about yellowjacket biology may be useful here (and yes, the black and white bald-faced \"hornets\" are just another species of yellowjacket).\u00a0First, the nests are not perennial, they are annual. In fact, the nest is now reaching its peak population and should begin crashing within a month. The colony should be completely dead by November.\u00a0  If you cannot avoid the nest until it collapses you will need to kill the nest. Given its height, I would recommend bringing in a pest control professional. To do it yourself would involve climbing a ladder and spraying an insecticide formulated for yellowjacket control into the entrance of the colony (which is the hole at the bottom of the nest). There is a risk that the yellowjackets could fly out at you while on the ladder, causing you to loose balance and fall.\u00a0  There is a great (out of print) University of Idaho Extension document that goes over your options.

My plan is to wait till late twilight or full nightfall and from a reasonable distance spray the entrance of the nest and then the entire nest till it appears wet.\u00a0\u00a0 Will the darkness provide me any protection from the hornets?

        "utterance": "Your plan to spray the nest at twilight or nightfall is a good approach, as hornets are generally less active during these times, which should provide you some protection. Ensure you are wearing protective clothing, including long sleeves, pants, gloves, and eye protection, to minimize the risk of stings. The Spectracide PRO you have should be effective, especially with its 20 ft spray reach, allowing you to maintain a safe distance. One treatment may be sufficient, but it's important to monitor the nest for any remaining activity the following day. If you still observe hornet activity, a second treatment may be necessary.

        "utterance": "It sounds like your bloomerang lilacs are experiencing some stress, likely due to the initial hot weather and possibly inconsistent soil moisture levels. The fact that the branch is still green is a good sign, indicating that it may recover. It's not uncommon for newly planted lilacs to show some wilting as they establish themselves. \n\nRegarding pruning, it's generally okay to prune lilacs, even in the first few years, especially if you're removing dead or severely damaged branches. However, since the branch is still green, you might want to wait and see if it recovers before cutting it off. Ensure that your watering is consistent and that the soil is not too wet or too dry. The moisture tester readings suggest that the soil near the branches is quite dry, so you might need to adjust your watering to ensure even moisture distribution. \n\nAs for disease, without seeing the images, it's hard to diagnose, but if the rest of the plant looks healthy and there's no sign of spots or discoloration on the leaves, it might just be stress from the transplant and environmental conditions. Keep monitoring the plants, and if you notice any worsening or additional symptoms, consider consulting a local extension service or a plant pathologist for a more detailed analysis.",

        "dialog_context": "user: Hi!\r\nI have about 25 rose bushes in my back yard. They get plenty of sunlight and water. The leaves are green, but they don\u2019t produce any roses at all - they haven\u2019t for the last 2-3 years. Any idea what the cause and cure might be?\nexpert: There are a number of possibilities, and some might be overlapping. One of our primary suspects with roses is deer...do any deer visit the yard or browse nearby overnight?\u00a0They are very fond of roses, especially flower buds. If deer are a problem, a physical barrier (netting or a fence) or a chemical barrier (repellents that make the plant smell/taste bad to them) would be needed, though repellents are not always permanently effective.  Are the shrubs pruned back each winter\u00a0(around February or so)? If not, that might be one reason they don't look very vigorous or balanced in shape. Shrub (non-climbing) roses are best pruned back to around 15-18 inches off the ground, more or less, each winter or very early spring so that they are stimulated to produce vigorous regrowth that should flower better than older wood.  Even setting aside the flowering issue, these plants look weak, like they are not growing well. You mention they get plenty of sun, but are they getting a full 6-8 or more hours worth of unobstructed summer sun? If not, that can reduce plant vigor and suppress bloom.  You also mention plenty of water...are they only being watered on an as-needed basis, based on checking the soil (and recent weather), or are they on some sort of irrigation cycle that runs on a programmed timer?\u00a0If the latter, they may be getting over-watered, in which case root loss can result in branch dieback, sparser foliage, and poor/no bloom. Ideally, the soil near the roots should be checked about six inches deep and watered well only when it's becoming somewhat dry to the touch at that depth. Roses aren't very tolerant of constantly-damp soil, and extra watering will also leach certain nutrients out of the soil faster than watering only occasionally. While routine fertilization of roses should not normally be necessary in most soils, a laboratory soil test may reveal a deficiency in that planting area that might benefit from supplemental fertilizer. (We can help to interpret test results if you choose to send a sample to one of the labs on that page.)  The close-up of a blasted (dead) bud and dying stem could have been caused by an infection, but it's hard to tell from the photo. You can explore our rose diagnostic page to see if any of the ailments common to roses in our area seem to be affecting your plants. Some rose varieties are more vulnerable to certain diseases than others, though even resistant plants\u00a0are not perfectly immune. If/when fungicides are warranted, they need to be applied preventatively to protect still-healthy growth, since they are not able to cure any existing disease. Several repeat applications per year, each year, are usually needed when a rose is particularly vulnerable to a given disease (black spot, for example).\u00a0Weak or infected branches can be pruned off and discarded (don't compost).  Miri\nuser: Wow\u2026 Thanks for the quick & thorough response! \u00a0  Deer are definitely an issue \u2013 we get lots of them. It\u2019s odd that they seemed to leave them alone for several years, but now they seem to have added them to their diet. \u00a0  Also, I have not been cutting them back in the late winter. I\u2019m guessing it would not be good to cut them back now? \u00a0  I only water them when there is a long dry spell, but I\u2019m glad to know that I should not risk over-watering them. \u00a0  I might look into a soil test and the diagnostic page. \u00a0  Again, thanks for your help!! \u00a0  Best, Dan\n",

        "utterance": "It's generally best to wait until late winter or very early spring to prune your rose bushes. Pruning at this time encourages vigorous new growth and better flowering. Pruning now, if it's not late winter, might stimulate new growth that could be damaged by upcoming cold weather, depending on your local climate. If you are in a region where winters are mild, light pruning can be done now to remove any dead or diseased wood, but major pruning should be reserved for late winter. Since deer are an issue, consider implementing some protective measures to prevent them from eating the buds and new growth.",

These varieties are known for having no thorns, not producing noticeable flowers, and dropping small seed pods. They also maintain a dark green foliage until fall. Honey Locust trees typically have a deep root system, which can be beneficial for stability and drought resistance. However, the exact root depth can vary depending on soil conditions and other environmental factors. If you want to be absolutely certain, you might consider consulting a local arborist who can examine the tree in person.",

These larvae feed on the leaves, creating a skeletonized appearance, which can stress the plant. However, if your roses are still budding, it indicates that the plant is managing the stress reasonably well. For future management, you can consider using horticultural oils or insecticidal soaps early in the season when the larvae are first noticed. Regular monitoring and early intervention can help minimize damage. Additionally, encouraging natural predators like birds can also help control their population.",

If you choose to replace the tree, pagoda dogwoods can be purchased at a larger size from nurseries, which would provide an immediate impact in your garden. They are relatively slow-growing, so starting with a larger specimen might be beneficial. Redbuds are indeed a beautiful choice for a Japanese-themed garden and can provide lovely spring blooms. While they are slower growing, they can be quite striking once established. If you prefer a faster-growing option, consider Japanese maples or flowering cherries, which also fit well with your garden theme. If you decide to rehabilitate the existing pagoda dogwood, training new suckers to replace the damaged stem is a viable option, though they may be weaker initially. Regular pruning and care can help strengthen them over time. Ultimately, the choice depends on your preference for immediate impact versus long-term growth and development.",

        "dialog_context": "user: About 10 years ago, we planted 3 Golden Thread False Cypress as foundation plants near our house.  The nursery tag stated that the height at 10 years would be 2-3 ft.  Well, they must like the location as they have grown much higher and wider.  Even with substantial trimming each year, they grow taller and wider than I would like. This year, they are about 5' high and 6' wide.  They seem to grow more than I can trim and still retain their graceful shape.  My Question:  Will the plants regenerate if I prune the bushes down to bare wood? I would prefer to keep the false cypress but they are getting out of hand. Thank you!\nexpert: Plant mature size information on tags can unfortunately be misleading, not necessarily because the nursery grower was being deceptive, but because lots of factors influence growth rate, and plants also never truly stop growing as they age (though they can slow down). Without the botanical and cultivar name of the plants you're growing, it's hard to say what their typical size winds-up being, but if they are 'Gold Mop' (a very widely-sold and widely-planted variety), then can easily mature in the 10-foot range once they are a couple decades old or so. (They're also usually much yellower than this picture implies...are they growing in full sun or does the exposure only receive morning or evening sun? More shade turns such yellow cultivars greener, and might also make them stay less compact.)  Unfortunately no, you can't prune them down to size or drastically cut them back to force regrowth. With very few exceptions, conifers (needled evergreens like cypress, pine, juniper, and spruce) cannot produce new growth on old wood. Branch wood that is several years old no longer has dormant growth buds that would be stimulated into growth by pruning, compared to broadleaf evergreens (holly, boxwood, etc.) that do. Therefore, when any style of pruning makes cuts back into wood that's more than a few years old, that cut is permanent and no regrowth fills back in.  If you want to keep the plants and have a space for them to grow larger without blocking a view or running into obstacles, you can transplant them (now is probably fine, or very early autumn or\u00a0next spring) out of this space. We can offer ideas for replacements if you'd like, though we'd need information about the site conditions in order to narrow-down some options. (How much direct summer sun it receives, how well-drained, damp, or dry the soil is, if deer browse in the area, and what mature size (without relying on pruning) the space can accommodate.)  Miri\nuser: Thank you so much for your reply! Unfortunately, we don't have an appropriate place to transplant but we would really appreciate your recommendations as to replacement plants. \u00a0The site is NNW in front of a low roofed breezeway, well-drained soil, gets morning and afternoon sun and deer grazing is a problem. \u00a0Mature size (without relying on pruning) of up to\u00a03.5'. We'd be open evergreen and/or deciduous plants. Thank you!\nexpert: Thank you for the site description. Below are some ideas, but it's just a starter list and is far from exhaustive\u00a0(though the deer browsing pressure will keep the list overall fairly limited). Since you are open to both evergreen and deciduous plants, you have lots of choices, especially since a lot of plants these days have cultivars on the market that are dwarf or compact compared to the regular form. The list below is in no order of importance; some species listed come in many cultivar forms, so they can vary in mature height and traits like leaf color. Botanical names are in parentheses, since common names sometimes vary. We'll assume the sun level in summer that you describe is at least 4-6 hours of direct sun (\"full sun\" is generally 6+ hours of unobstructed sun in summer), based on the note that it faces NNW, which is usually not a full sun exposure.  Depending on the space available width-wise, we'd recommend using a mix of species (or at least more than one), so they will have an overall higher resilience to a potential pest or disease outbreak (or weather damage) since plant tolerances and stressors can vary from one species to another. A mixed planting also allows for more seasonal aesthetic interest or the use of contrasting leaf textures or colors.  EvergreenBoxwood (Buxus, several species and numerous cultivars) While this group\u00a0has their potential problems (to be fair, everything can get infected/infested by something), look for cultivars that tout good resistance to disease (like Boxwood\u00a0Blight) and insects (Boxwood Leafminer). Several\u00a0have been introduced in recent years that are resistant to both. Some cultivars even have colorful foliage (white-edged or yellow-edged), though we don't know the resistance ranking of those in particular. Boxwoods trim easily, but should ideally be left to their own natural shape since heavy pruning increases their vulnerability to disease.Chinese Holly (Ilex cornuta) The spinier-leaved cultivars are unpalatable to deer, though surprisingly, most other hollies can be eaten. A few cultivars stay small enough, but also can be pruned. Many (if they are female) can produce berries without needing pollination.Inkberry Holly (Ilex glabra) Included if you prefer using a locally-native evergreen, though they grow and look their best in full sun. Spineless leaves must taste bad to deer, since they usually leave them alone.\u00a0Look for a truly-dwarf cultivar like 'Gem Box' or 'Stongbox' since popularly-grown varieties like 'Shamrock' are not as compact over time\u00a0a their plant tags might imply, and pruning Inkberry down to size is not something the plants handle well (from an aesthetic standpoint). Be aware that this holly species is naturally not as dense-growing as the widely-grown non-natives like Japanese Holly or Chinese Holly, especially if grown in less than full sun.Japanese Plum Yew (Cephalotaxus harringtonia) Unlike their Yew (Taxus) cousins, these are unappealing to deer, though just about anything could get exploratory nibbles. Light trimming is okay to restrain size, but there are a few compact-growing cultivars that should fit; they will mature wider than tall.Leucothoe (Leucothoe axillaris or L. fontanesiana) Branches naturally arch into a fountain-like shape (plants grow wider than tall), and some varieties have leaves marbled with cream, edged in white, or which turn burgundy-red in winter.\u00a0White blooms decorate the branch tips\u00a0around mid-spring. Native to parts of the eastern U.S., though technically not in Maryland.American Holly (Ilex opaca) Native. While much too tall in its wild form, there are a couple dwarf cultivars that stay small enough to use here, though they will (very slowly) grow wider than tall. 'Maryland Dwarf', appropriately enough, is one that is becoming a bit easier to find at area nurseries, though overall dwarf cultivars of this species are somewhat rare. Since growth is so slow, it will take several years to fill-in from the purchased size, and they can be proportionately more expensive than some other shrubs their size, especially among hollies. American Holly is very flexible about how much sun it gets, and is also tolerant of damp sites as long as they aren't too soggy.Eastern Redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) Native. Like the above, most forms will be much too big to use in that spot. However, there are some dwarf cultivars, like 'Gray Owl' and 'Gray Guardian' (which also happen to be blue-gray in color). Junipers as a group prefer full sun, but if they receive enough light, they can handle a bit less than full sun. These too will grow wider than tall (to the point of being around 4 to 6 feet wide each, depending on cultivar). Light trimming is possible, but otherwise they look their best unpruned. DeciduousSummersweet (Clethra alnifolia) Native. Dwarf cultivars stay small enough to fit in your space, though they can slowly spread (sucker) into a clump wider than tall. Flowers appear in summer (white, as the few pink forms are taller-growing) and are very sweetly fragrant, attracting lots of pollinators. Fall color is yellow. They prefer soil that skews more damp than dry, so if an overhang keeps them from getting some rain, monitoring for watering during dry spells would be beneficial.Virginia Sweetspire (Itea virginica) Native. Cultivar height differences aren't drastic, but the one most well-suited to your needs might be 'Little Henry' since it stays shorter. Flowers are lightly scented and appear around late spring. Fall color can be anywhere from burgundy-red, to red-orange, to a mix of\u00a0red, orange, and yellow. Sometimes a handful fall-colored leaves remain on the stems for the winter.Bluebeard (Caryopteris x clandonensis) Flowers best in full sun, but as long as it gets at least about 5 hours worth, it should still bloom well. Gray-tinged foliage is somewhat felted in texture and the lavender-blue blooms appear late, anywhere between late July and early September or so. Poplar with pollinators. Several cultivars exist, but there are minimal differences between them, and all (or most) will fit in that space with little to no pruning. Prefers to be a bit\u00a0on the dry side and tolerates drought well, so avoid growing near any roof downspout outlets that might empty close by.Slender Deutzia (Deutzia gracilis) Although potentially a little too short, this wide-spreading shrub will tolerate full sun and part sun, but will flower best with full sun. White or pink-and-white blooms appear in spring, and foliage might turn burgundy-maroon or reddish in autumn\u00a0(depends on the cultivar). Some cultivars also have white-edged or golden-leaved forms. If too short by itself, it might be useful in front of taller plants.Glossy Abelia (Abelia x grandiflora, might be under the other\u00a0name Linnaea x grandiflora) Placed here because, while it sometimes is more evergreen, this trait can vary quite a bit based on weather; it probably falls somewhere in between, shedding some leaves but keeping a few. Many cultivars exist, most within your desired height range. Many have colorful foliage, and all produce white (rarely light pink) flowers, which appear in summer and can rebloom\u00a0until early fall. Easy to trim if needed, but generally the only pruning done is to remove the occasional errant branch that grows lankily above the rest.American Beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) Native, though not locally; all other Callicarpa sold are non-native, and a few may spread from seed; this species is sometimes hard to find. Tolerant of sun or semi-shade, its blooms are not super showy but appear as pale pinkish-lavender clusters in summer. The main show is the neon purple berries that ripen in autumn, though they won't necessarily last through the winter. Fall foliage color isn't super showy, but tends to be yellow. If a harsh winter or cold snap kills some branch tips, the shrub should regrow well and look normal by summer.Redosier Dogwood (Cornus sericea/stolonifera) Native-ish (rare in MD), though lots of other \"redtwig\"\u00a0dogwood species related to this one that are common at nurseries\u00a0are non-native. Flowers are showy but don't look like typical tree dogwood blooms; they are ivory-white and appear late spring or early summer. Berries are white (on other species of similar-looking shrubby dogwoods, they can be blue-black). Like their tree cousins, they are known for reliably showy fall color in the red range. Plants might sucker a little if thriving, but are easy to control with pruning. Stem color blushes a vibrant red (or orange or yellow, depending on cultivar) during winter, dulling in summer. It can help the plant maintain a fresh, colorful look to prune off the oldest, thickest stems every few years to force new growth to replace it.  Miri\nuser: Thank you, again! Those are great ideas. We have a \"Little Henry\" Virginia Sweetspire in our yard and are really enjoying it. I think that will be one of the plants\u00a0we will plant to replace the false cypress.\u00a0 We also planted 3 Inkberry Hollies in our yard. One of them is getting pretty leggy. Will trimming it below the green leaves\u00a0help it to fill out, or, once it loses the bottom leaves, are they\u00a0gone forever?? Also, if we transplant the Inkberry to a sunnier location, will the sunnier area encourage it to fill out at the bottom? Thank you!\n",

        "utterance": "Inkberry Holly (Ilex glabra) can sometimes become leggy, especially if it is not receiving enough sunlight. Trimming below the green leaves is generally not recommended for Inkberry Holly, as it may not regenerate well from old wood, similar to other hollies. Once the lower leaves are lost, they typically do not regrow. However, moving the Inkberry to a sunnier location can help encourage denser growth overall, including at the base, as it will receive more light to stimulate new growth. When transplanting, ensure the plant is well-watered and consider doing it in early spring or fall for the best results. Regular light pruning of the tips can also help maintain a fuller shape over time.",

I have been collecting cardboard but am concerned the mulch will separate, expose the cardboard and create an eyesore.  Another suggestion is burlap covered with mulch which allows for planing in the future if desired.  The front yard gets a lot of sun.\r\n\r\nAlso what do you suggest for mulch?  pine fines, wood mulch or wood chips?  \r\n\r\nThank you for any suggestions.\nexpert: Hi, Riley you trying to replace the grass areas or are you wanting to cover up weeds in the established garden beds?\u00a0 If it is for the grass area, you don't need to use the cardboard or burlap and can just use a thick layer of arborist wood chips which can be free or a small price. Shredded wood mulch will look more finished for the front lawn but that can be a personal preference. We actually don't advice using cardboard to smother since it can contain PFAS or forever chemicals or micro plastics. The burlap would probably allow the weeds to break through it rather quickly and it could also be coated in a material that isn't good for the soil. Typically the layer should be about 6-8 inches thick to deter any weeds from growing up through it. You can then plant into it by pushing aside a 'hole', adding some compost and planting plugs or a plant you wanted. In time the wood chips will break down and won't be so high. You can search for free arborist wood chips online and it should give you some options to sign up for some. It could be delivered on the same day or next day\u00a0and it could be a large load. If it is more than you need you can always use what you need then offer it up for grabs in a local gardening group.\u00a0 You could also put down woodchips to smother the turf/weeds, and then top dress is a more finished mulch for a more uniform look.\u00a0 Let us know if you have further questions.\u00a0 Emily\nuser: Hi, Emerson you for the response. I am trying to rid the \"lawn\" area the is almost all weeds. \u00a0The garden areas have already been mulched with pine fines. \u00a0I am on Bartletts wait list for wood chips for a long time. Perhaps I will find another source. It would be a lot cheaper than hiring someone to do cardboard and mulch.  \u00a0  I am a little concerned about where to have them put the mulch. My front yard is surrounded by garden beds and any pile would smother them. I guess that leaves the end of the driveway. \u00a0  \u00a0  Is it recommended to water wood chips once they are placed? \u00a0How often? How long does it take for wood chips 6' deep before it's ready for eco lawn seeds?\u00a0  \u00a0  Joanna\nexpert: Hello, Reese,  A wood chip delivery truck will need easy access to dump the load in one spot, and the closer to the street, the more likely they will have an easy time unloading. For many properties, that is the end of the driveway. You might not get a notification it's coming, so plan ahead for getting your\u00a0vehicle in/out, if needed.  You do not need to wet-down wood chips, but if they're dusty (not likely), you can. Wood chips should not be placed over an area to be seeded, though, unless you can wait long enough for the wood chips to self-compost into a fine \"soil\" for sowing on. Otherwise, you'd use the mulch to smother the weeds, then remove it to sow seeds on the weed-free soil surface. (Dead weed growth should ideally be removed before sowing or it will act like a mulch and interfere with some germination.)  Depending on what species are\u00a0in the \"eco lawn\"\u00a0seed mix\u00a0you are referring to, cool-season grasses are often best sown in the autumn, not spring, so in that sense having the wood chips lay on the existing lawn/weeds for the summer and being more broken-down and therefore\u00a0sow-ready by late summer or autumn may work out well without having to move them out of the way (or having to move much less material aside for sowing). We don't have a specific timeframe to reference for how quickly wood chips will degrade because it will depend on the species of tree that the chips were made from, the weather, and the microbial diversity in your soil below the spread chips.  Miri\nuser: Miri,  \u00a0  Thank you for your response about wood chips. \u00a0I intend to sow eco grass in the fall so I will not be using wood chips to kill the weeds. \u00a0  \u00a0  U of MD Extension does not recommend using cardboard under the mulch to kill weeds.You suggest putting a layer of mulch directly on top of the weeds. Would it behoove me to remove all the weeds before putting the mulch? (That has been suggested by a couple landscapers). \u00a0Do you recommend wood mulch or pine fine?

        "utterance": "Hello, Reese, since you plan to sow eco grass seeds in the fall and do not intend to plant in the wood chips, you can use the mulch to smother the weeds. It's generally not necessary to remove all the weeds before applying the mulch, as the thick layer of mulch (around 6-8 inches) should effectively suppress them. However, removing the larger or more persistent weeds might help ensure a more uniform surface for sowing later. Between wood mulch and pine fines, wood mulch is typically more effective for smothering weeds due to its larger particle size, which can create a thicker barrier. Pine fines, being finer, might not be as effective in suppressing weeds but can be used as a top layer for a more finished look. Once the mulch has been laid down, it will gradually break down over the summer, and by fall, you should have a suitable surface for sowing your eco grass seeds. Just ensure that the mulch has decomposed enough to allow for seed contact with the soil. If needed, you can rake aside some of the mulch to expose the soil for better seed-to-soil contact. Best of luck with your eco lawn project!",

        "utterance": "Given that the roots are 17 feet from the tree trunk, cutting them may not immediately harm the tree, but it could potentially affect its stability and health over time. Red maples can be sensitive to root disturbance, and cutting large roots can make the tree more susceptible to disease and reduce its ability to absorb water and nutrients. Additionally, cutting roots near a foundation can sometimes lead to structural issues if the roots are providing support. It would be wise to consult with a certified arborist who can assess the specific situation and provide guidance tailored to your tree and property.

It's a little difficult to tell from the photos but it looks like\u00a0Twig and Branch Canker.\u00a0 Symptoms: sunken discolored areas on twigs and small branches. These cankers are caused by fungal pathogens (Botryosphaeria sp. and Diplodia sp.) and are rarely serious but can lead to limb dieback. The fungus Botryosphaeria appears to be more severe on pink flowering cultivars. Healthy plants are less susceptible to these diseases. Water during droughts and avoid over-fertilization to prevent excessive succulent growth. There are no effective chemical controls for this disease once diagnosed, so prune out infected branches promptly. If that doesn't sound right, let us know and we can look further into it.

Look for signs of dysentery inside the hive and check the frames for any unusual patterns or dead bees.\n\n2. **Sample Testing**: If possible, collect a sample of the bees and send it to a lab for Nosema testing to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n3. **Sanitation**: Clean the affected areas of the hive to prevent further spread. Remove any fecal matter from the hive entrance and porch.\n\n4. **Medication**: If Nosema is confirmed, consider treating the hive with Fumagillin, a common treatment for Nosema.

Ensure they have adequate food resources and consider providing a pollen substitute if natural sources are scarce.\n\n6. **Protect the Other Hive**: Keep a close watch on the other hive for any similar symptoms.

        "dialog_context": "user: I have a giant pot of chives and they started out doing very well again this year. Now they are covered with little black bugs! What should I do?\nexpert: Thank you for your question Brianna, Your chives look like they are infested with black aphids. Many gardens host some aphids. On healthy plants, they don't cause much harm, and beneficial insects, including ladybugs and parasitic wasps, keep them in check. Aphids can become more of a problem when the plants are stressed by drought, poor soil conditions, overwintering or overcrowding. Unfortunately, aphids can reproduce at amazing speed and a large colony that can literally suck the life out of your plants. The key to dealing with them is knowing when you need to take action, and then having the right tricks up your sleeve to keep them under control. How to Identify Aphids: Often the first sign of an aphid infestation is twisted and curled leaves, yellowing foliage, stunted or dead shoots, and sluggish plant growth. Damage is usually most noticeable on shoot tips and new growth, along with unopened flower buds. When you take a closer look at these damaged plant parts, particularly on the undersides of young leaves and developing stems, you'll likely find lots of aphids crowded together. Aphids range in color from green to yellow, brown, red, or even black. Aphids cause damage by sucking sap from tender plant parts. As they feast, they excrete a sugary substance called honeydew. A fungus called sooty mold grows on the honeydew and blocks light from your plant, but is otherwise harmless. You can wash your plant leaves with water to get rid of the honeydew and sooty mold. How to Get Rid of Aphids: When an aphid population explodes and begins to cause noticeable damage to leaves, stems, and buds, it's time to act right away. The sooner you can deal with the infestation, the better chance you have of eliminating or controlling the aphids. Spray with Water: The safest and fastest way to control aphids is to spray them off your plants with a strong stream of water from the garden hose. Aphids are easily knocked off plants and once they are knocked off a plant, they rarely climb back on. Insecticidal Soaps and Horticultural Oils: These controls are low-risk to people and the environment and can be applied to food crops. They'll kill aphids, but must be applied on a regular basis during heavy infestations, since aphids reproduce so quickly. Insecticidal soaps and horticultural oils only kill aphids when they come in direct contact, so you'll need to spray both tops and undersides of leaves and reapply frequently until the pests are completely gone. Keep in mind that insecticidal soaps and horticultural oil will kill beneficial insects as well, so only apply it to target pests. Crush Aphids with Your Fingers: If the infestation isn't too heavy, you can squash aphids by gently rubbing your thumb and fingertips over your plants' leaves and stems wherever you see aphids. Check back every few days to see if you need to repeat the procedure. How to Prevent Aphids: Preventing large numbers of aphids from making themselves at home is possible. In addition to making sure your plants have the water, light, and nutrients they need, here are a few more ways to help keep aphid numbers down. Remove dead stems and weeds from around the plants. You can cover plants with a barrier to insects (like cheese cloth or row covers). You can also grow certain plants nearby to attract beneficial insects like lady bugs which eat aphids (plants like marigolds,calendula, sunflower, daisy, alyssum, or dill). For more information about aphids and treatment I would refer you to two excellent reviews available on the web: one from the University of California and the other from Louisania State University.  http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7404.html www.lsu.edu%2Fdepartments%2Fentomology%2Fassets%2Faphidparasitoids.pdf&psig=AOvVaw2f_F_9v7U87MSX7mf0kjh0&ust=<personal data hidden>41503\" class=\"redactor-autoparser-object\">https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CAQQw7AJahcKEwjog-bjgsP-AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lsu.edu%2Fdepartments%2Fentomology%2Fassets%2Faphidparasitoids.pdf&psig=AOvVaw2f_F_9v7U87MSX7mf0kjh0&ust=<personal data hidden>41503 If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.

        "dialog_context": "user: Hi!\r\nI have about 25 rose bushes in my back yard. They get plenty of sunlight and water. The leaves are green, but they don\u2019t produce any roses at all - they haven\u2019t for the last 2-3 years. Any idea what the cause and cure might be?\nexpert: There are a number of possibilities, and some might be overlapping. One of our primary suspects with roses is deer...do any deer visit the yard or browse nearby overnight?\u00a0They are very fond of roses, especially flower buds. If deer are a problem, a physical barrier (netting or a fence) or a chemical barrier (repellents that make the plant smell/taste bad to them) would be needed, though repellents are not always permanently effective.  Are the shrubs pruned back each winter\u00a0(around February or so)? If not, that might be one reason they don't look very vigorous or balanced in shape. Shrub (non-climbing) roses are best pruned back to around 15-18 inches off the ground, more or less, each winter or very early spring so that they are stimulated to produce vigorous regrowth that should flower better than older wood.  Even setting aside the flowering issue, these plants look weak, like they are not growing well. You mention they get plenty of sun, but are they getting a full 6-8 or more hours worth of unobstructed summer sun? If not, that can reduce plant vigor and suppress bloom.  You also mention plenty of water...are they only being watered on an as-needed basis, based on checking the soil (and recent weather), or are they on some sort of irrigation cycle that runs on a programmed timer?\u00a0If the latter, they may be getting over-watered, in which case root loss can result in branch dieback, sparser foliage, and poor/no bloom. Ideally, the soil near the roots should be checked about six inches deep and watered well only when it's becoming somewhat dry to the touch at that depth. Roses aren't very tolerant of constantly-damp soil, and extra watering will also leach certain nutrients out of the soil faster than watering only occasionally. While routine fertilization of roses should not normally be necessary in most soils, a laboratory soil test may reveal a deficiency in that planting area that might benefit from supplemental fertilizer. (We can help to interpret test results if you choose to send a sample to one of the labs on that page.)  The close-up of a blasted (dead) bud and dying stem could have been caused by an infection, but it's hard to tell from the photo. You can explore our rose diagnostic page to see if any of the ailments common to roses in our area seem to be affecting your plants. Some rose varieties are more vulnerable to certain diseases than others, though even resistant plants\u00a0are not perfectly immune. If/when fungicides are warranted, they need to be applied preventatively to protect still-healthy growth, since they are not able to cure any existing disease. Several repeat applications per year, each year, are usually needed when a rose is particularly vulnerable to a given disease (black spot, for example).\u00a0Weak or infected branches can be pruned off and discarded (don't compost).  Miri\nuser: Wow\u2026 Thanks for the quick & thorough response! \u00a0  Deer are definitely an issue \u2013 we get lots of them. It\u2019s odd that they seemed to leave them alone for several years, but now they seem to have added them to their diet. \u00a0  Also, I have not been cutting them back in the late winter. I\u2019m guessing it would not be good to cut them back now? \u00a0  I only water them when there is a long dry spell, but I\u2019m glad to know that I should not risk over-watering them. \u00a0  I might look into a soil test and the diagnostic page. \u00a0  Again, thanks for your help!! \u00a0  Best, Dan\nexpert: You're welcome!  Deer are probably the main factor in this case, then, though the other conditions we mentioned bear looking into, since more than one problem can still overlap and affect the plants. Deer can change habits as they become more over-crowded or desperate for food (they generally don't eat the invasive plants taking over local woodlands). Additionally,\u00a0perhaps there were excluded from another property or area that they used to be able to browse in. Many deer in residential neighborhoods actually stay there their entire lives, rather than coming and going from wooded areas further away, so their diet depends on what they can find in home yards and wild spaces in between. You can try periodically spraying the rose foliage with repellents...it might be enough, at least to teach the deer that this isn't a plant they will find appealing. The trouble is that repellents wear off over time and in rain, and sometimes deer are too hungry to care, or just get used to the smell/taste and eat the plants they want to eat anyway, so it's an uphill battle.  Miri\nuser: Thanks!! \u00a0 Would it make sense to cut the bushes back now, or wait til nest February?\u00a0  Best, Dan\nexpert: Apologies -- you can do some pruning now, but lighter than the wholesale cutback that's usually\u00a0done in late winter...maybe shorten some stems a bit if they have sparse growth on the tips but are putting out new buds lower on the stem. You can also remove any spindly stems that are not putting out any leaves, if present.\u00a0Otherwise, it might be best to wait to prune\u00a0until they have more foliage and look lusher, since they need all the energy from photosynthesis they can get right now with such limited foliage.  Miri\nuser: Thanks!! \u00a0  Best, Dan\nexpert: You're welcome!\nuser: Hey, \u00a0  Just so you know, I took your advice regarding deer spray and fertilization and we are getting plenty of roses . \u00a0  I have another issue:  \u00a0  We bought three small hibiscus trees last year.

Nathan Columbia, Howard County\nexpert: Hello, Jordan,  While stormwater runoff can certainly carry pollutants of many types, we do not think it would be a major concern or risk in this setting. Plus, as the water moves through the soil profile (granted, some runs along the surface before soaking in), the soil and plant roots will be filtering some of it. Adding plants along the property line to help buffer this runoff, both for erosion's sake alone as well as reducing any contaminants, may be worth considering. Unfortunately there are probably an equal or greater number of pollutant sources separate from anything in the runoff that we doubt it's a significant contributor to health risk, especially in a residential area compared to, say,\u00a0a more industrial/commercial or agricultural\u00a0development.  The location of your produce beds looks fine to us, though perhaps a bit shady, although it's hard to tell this time of year due to the sun angle. The majority of vegetable and fruit plants require full sun (6-8 or more hours of direct summer sun) to thrive, though a few will do reasonably well with partial shade. Soil drainage, which keeps the root zone well-oxygenated enough for plant health, is also very important, but as long as any runoff water seeps into the soil profile quickly enough that after a heavy rain the garden beds are not too soggy, this feature is probably also fine. (If it does skew wet, you could try raising the beds up higher by making the sides deeper so the planting level is at a greater height above\u00a0the surrounding grade.)  While we agree that there can be conflicting information about roof runoff water, in our opinion, it would be safer to not use it on edible plants, but using it to water ornamental plants (anything not harvested for food) should be fine.\u00a0There are many factors that affect the quality of collected water \u2013 roof composition, animals on the roof, water storage conditions, etc. Bird or squirrel feces on the roof, for example, could contaminate the rain barrel water.\u00a0These references below might be of interest: Limited studies have been done on rain barrel use for food crops. A study done by Rutgers University has recommendations: Rain Barrels Part IV: Testing and Applying Harvested Water to Irrigate a Vegetable GardenHere is a study on the topic done in Philadelphia: Assessment of Water Quality in Roof-Harvested Rainwater Barrels in Greater PhiladelphiaHere's information on a citizen scientist project that began a few years ago to look into the safety of using rain barrel water (see link). It becomes a personal choice based on your level of comfort. Using potable water (city or well water) carries less risk than rain barrel water. If you do decide to rain barrel water, we'd recommend you water at the base of the plants, right into the soil, to limit contact with edible plant parts, such as leafy greens. Avoiding extra leaf wetness\u00a0also helps to prevent plant diseases, regardless of water quality. If you are not comfortable using it on your edibles, feel free to water your other flowers and landscape plants with rain barrel water. We realize you're more concerned with carcinogenic residues versus microbes, but the microbial content might still be a risk if someone is immunocompromised from treatment.  Regarding the use of a disinfectant, Rutgers University recommends the following: Rain barrel users should make sure to clean the barrel with a 3% bleach solution before collecting water to irrigate a vegetable/herb garden. Household, unscented bleach with a 5\u20136% chlorine solution can be added at the rate of one-eighth teaspoon (8 drops) of bleach per gallon of water. A typical 55 gallon rain barrel would need approximately one ounce of bleach added on a monthly basis. During periods of frequent rainfall, bimonthly treatment may be necessary. Wait approximately 24 hours after the addition of bleach to allow the chlorine to dissipate before using the water. Note that household bleach is not labeled for use in water treatment by the Food and Drug Administration although it is frequently recommended for emergency disinfection of drinking water (USEPA, 2006b).  Mulch would\u00a0not contain CCA treatments, which were discontinued around twenty years ago\u00a0(in lumber...they were not in mulch anyway unless it was made from ground-up pallets or other recycled wood). The only mulch that we think could (but not necessarily would)\u00a0have concerning residues would be the dyed types, which use recycled wood more so than actual bark. Shredded hardwood bark, pine bark, pine needles, leaf litter, and arborist wood chips are all suitable organic mulch choices that break down into good soil-enriching organic matter.  We do always recommend soil testing for the basic nutrient and acidity (pH) analysis, plus for lead (other heavy metals may also be an optional add-on, depending on the lab), when growing vegetables and fruits. Lead contamination is less a risk for plant absorption and more of an issue of lead-tainted soil dust coating harvested greens or fruits. This is one reason why it's always recommended to rinse produce off well before consuming it, even with home-grown plants. Our Soil Testing and Soil Testing Labs page includes a list of suggested labs you can choose from, and we can help to interpret the results if desired. Note that some level of non-zero lead presence is to be expected in basically any human-developed area, but as long as it's below the threshold for risk, remediation efforts would not be needed. Depending on how busy the lab is, results may take 2-3 weeks to arrive.  Fruit trees are high-maintenance crops compared to small fruits (berries) and vegetables. They require specialized pruning, routine pesticide use (even if organic)\u00a0to prevent problems that could harm tree health or ruin a crop one year, and fruit thinning and other seasonal tasks. If you prefer to avoid any type of pesticide use on the trees, be aware that you might not get usable fruit every year. Some fruit trees require compatible pollinators in order to produce a crop, but if your trees are well-established already, this might be something you have already addressed.\u00a0We have recently revised our fruit page content, and you can find pages about specific fruits (some are lumped together if their care is similar) and their care and troubleshooting\u00a0in the linked page.  In short, while there are unfortunately a plethora of health risks in modern times (PFA \"forever chemicals,\" micro/nanoplastics, air pollution particulates, and so on), in our opinion,\u00a0any contaminants from a home vegetable garden grown with\u00a0responsible (following label directions)\u00a0or minimal pesticide use is unlikely to be a significant source of a health risk, and probably even outweighs any risk to some extent\u00a0with the benefits from\u00a0harvest quality/freshness of fresh-picked produce.  Miri\nuser: This was incredibly helpful.\u00a0\u00a0 The garden gets a lot of sun, just not in the morning unfortunately.Few follow up questions:- The hill behind us is steeper than the pictures show and our neighbor's mulch goes up to our fence line.\u00a0 Does this change your recommendations?- Any \"thirsty\"\u00a0 plants you'd recommend along the property line (that the deer won't eat)?\u00a0 Ideally should be evergreen.- Is there a particular type of mulch you'd recommend for fruit trees?- What is the concern for dyed mulch?\u00a0 Historically this is what I've used, but I actually pulled it out of my garden today because I'm finding processed wood, plastics, and some painted wood in it.- When is the best time (of year) to have the soil tested?Thank you again!NathanOn Tue, Apr 16, 2024 at 1:33\u202fPM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\n",

        "utterance": "Based on the information provided and the images, it seems like your Mexican Orange shrubs might be affected by powdery mildew, a common fungal disease. This is supported by the presence of a white powdery substance that doesn't rub off and the fact that the affected plant is in a shadier area, which can promote fungal growth. To manage this, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. **Improve Air Circulation**: Ensure there is good air circulation around the plants by pruning any dense growth and removing any debris around the base of the plants.\n\n2. **Watering Practices**: Since you use a sprinkler system, try to water early in the morning to allow the foliage to dry quickly. Avoid overhead watering if possible.\n\n3. **Fungicidal Treatment**: Consider applying a fungicide labeled for powdery mildew. Follow the instructions carefully for the best results.\n\n4. **Monitor and Maintain**: Keep an eye on the plants for any changes or spread of the mildew. Regular maintenance and monitoring can help prevent future outbreaks.\n\nIf the problem persists or worsens, you may want to consult with a local extension service or a professional for further assistance.",

I had a mealy worm outbreak 2 years ago and did a great deal to get them out of the basement greenhouse. Now overnight a Begonia developed powdery mildew according to a photo ID by ai copilot on Microsoft. The plant was out of a humidity dome ten minutes on a plastic bag with glass underneath. ChatOn ai knows a remarkable amount about terraium begonia but one important thing it said needs to be confirmed because of the huge disruption it causes. ChatOn said the begonia ruthaie released 1000 to 250000 spores in a ten minute period. It\u2019s a 2\u201d plant with 5% powdery mildew in a 2\u201d pot! The magnitude of cleaning it wants is vast. Can you tell me if it\u2019s having a hallucination or accurate.\r\n\r\nUrgent \r\n\r\nI took many protective measures but can this spore count be real. In a week nothing new got sick but I did destroy the tray and the exposed plants and so on. Looking at the picture of the destroyed plant could it be aba. Humidity was very high in tray.\nuser: The photo I took for Copilot was taken on their app so I don\u2019t have a photo the powdery mildew. It was on the leaf running along the vein. In its ID copilot mentioned that fact but I don\u2019t have more pictures. I used the Etsy app to send the picture to the seller.\nuser: I sent the only apple photo I had in the first email.\n",

        "utterance": "Based on the information provided, it seems there was a misidentification initially. Powdery mildew does not typically release such a high number of spores in such a short period, especially from a small plant like a 2-inch Begonia. The AI's spore count seems exaggerated. As for the current issue, if you are observing what you suspect to be spider mite larvae, it is consistent with the symptoms you described, especially given the high humidity and sunny location. Spider mites can thrive in such conditions. Since the plant is not valuable and you have others in good condition, discarding the affected tray is a reasonable approach to prevent further spread. Regular monitoring and maintaining lower humidity levels can help manage spider mite populations.",

Since the tree was planted last fall, it is still establishing its root system, which can cause stress and lead to early color change. The clay soil can also affect drainage and root development. Ensure that the tree is not planted too deeply, as this can cause stress. Since the irrigation system runs every other day, the tree might be receiving adequate water, but it's important to check that the soil is moist but not waterlogged.

If something is used there, it could affect the trees and shrubs in the area.\u00a0\u00a0Here is some information on herbicide damage:\u00a0 Herbicide Injury (Utah State Univ.)\nuser: Hi:  Thank you for your response. There must be another explanation. We don't use herbicides. I considered whether herbicides may have gotten into our irrigation water, but the damage to the plants is inconsistent. There are damaged plants right next to healthy plants. And the leaves sprouted before the water was turned on.\u00a0\u00a0I also considered a spring weather event that may have stunted the leaf growth. However, I would expect new growth to be free of damage. That is true in some cases, but not all. On some shrubs, the initial growth was normal and new growth is showing signs of problems. On one rose bush, some new growth appears perfectly healthy and some is stunted.  The issue is what it is. Despite the damage, most of the plants appear to be hanging on. However, I would love to know what is causing the problem so we can correct it or avoid it in the future.

If you suspect a fungal problem, applying a fungicide can be beneficial. Look for a fungicide that is specifically labeled for use on lilacs and follow the instructions carefully.

We are still dealing with a tremendous amount of seedlings sprouting from the ground. As my pictures show, they currently range from tiny to about 6 feet tall.\r\n\r\nWhile there are resources available, they focus mostly on identification and a little on how to deal with the main tree. But there are virtually no resources on how to find professional help for removal. At this point, it is beyond what I am capable of doing myself and searching for companies that specifically deal with invasive species removal, specifically in the Owings Mills area in Baltimore County, has thus far been fruitless. Do you have any suggestions on how to find help?\r\n\r\nI have some additional questions as well. Do all seedlings come from underground roots from the main tree or is it possible that seeds can fall from the main tree and spread that way as well? If any of the seedlings are from the cut tree, how long would they continue to grow? I have spent some time digging a few up, but would they just grow back?\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your time.\n",

Regarding your question about the suckers, if they are indeed coming from the root system of the tree that was cut down, they can continue to be a problem for several years. The root system of the Tree of Heaven is quite resilient and can continue to produce suckers as long as there is energy stored in the roots. Regular monitoring and removal of these suckers are necessary to eventually deplete the root's energy reserves. As for finding professional help, you might want to look for companies that specialize in invasive species management or ecological restoration. They often have experience dealing with persistent species like the Tree of Heaven. Additionally, contacting local extension services or environmental organizations in your area might provide leads on professionals who can assist with this issue.

Many thanks.\nexpert: From our veggie expert: Remove affected fruit. Don't overdue the N fertilization. Add one 1/4 cup of gypsum (calcium sulfate) per container and water it in.  Blossom end rot is\u00a0a response to a variety of plant stressors, not just low available calcium and inadequate water.\u00a0Plants could be space-stressed. Most varieties need at least a 5-gallon container. Some patio and container-type tomato varieties can be grown in 3 gallon containers.  From the Extension website on tomatoes: https://extension.umd.edu/resources/yard-garden/vegetables/tomatoes/  From me, just to check: 1. Be sure size of container is adequate 2. The container needs drainage holes 3. The container should have been filled with new potting soil mix at the start of the season (after cleaning the container of old soil and washing it with soap and water or dilute bleach to kill any diseases in the old soil) 4, Grow tomatoes varieties suitable to the container's size and plant deeply to develop more roots from buried stem 5. Water only if dry to the touch at 4\" soil depth. Watering too often leads to poor root growth and other problems 6. Add calcium as discussed above; I use a handful of agricultural lime when I plant 7. Add fertilizer if you did not start with new soil mix this year and have not added any this year; follow label directions 8. Remove lower leaves (up to 1ft on stem) if yellowing.  Your plants should recover and produce fruit.  Good luck Len\nuser: Thank you very much!  This is useful.\u00a0  To get gypsum, do I just go to the store and ask for it? Is there a brand I should look for?  I am also thinking that the plants may get be space stressed. Is it recommendable to transplant a plant to another container?  Many thanks!

There isn't a specific brand you need to look for, as most brands will provide the same benefits. As for transplanting, if you suspect that your plants are space-stressed, it can be beneficial to move them to a larger container.

Please let me know if you need any other info.\nexpert: The tree with a bend at the top may be from the wind,and may broken off. If those needles turn yellow rapidly then it is a break. Remove the broken section if possible or wait for it to drop to the ground. The tree will recover and send up a new leader in time.

The bend at the top of the tree was progressive. It started drooping over a period of time. Could it possibly be from the weight of all the cones at the top?

        "utterance": "Given the symptoms you've described and the fact that an arborist visit is already scheduled, there are a few general steps you can take to support your maple tree in the meantime. Ensure the tree is adequately watered, especially during dry spells, as water stress can exacerbate leaf drop and color change. Avoid fertilizing the tree at this time, as it can stress the tree further. Instead, focus on maintaining a consistent watering schedule. Mulching around the base of the tree can help retain soil moisture and regulate temperature. However, avoid piling mulch against the trunk. These steps can help stabilize the tree until the arborist can provide a more detailed assessment.",
