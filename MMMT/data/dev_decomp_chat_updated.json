        "value": "User: I'm trying to figure out why half of a vine maple in my front yard died. It is in a fairly protected between our house and the fence. The other half seems okay at this time. I looked for signs of insect damage, but couldn't really see anything. I have another vine maple and a Japanese maple in my backyard and they do not any sign of disease or damage. To my knowledge, there has been no pesticide exposure either. I'm concerned if it is a disease or insect killing the first one, that the other two will also eventually be affected.\nExpert: That is certainly concerning to see a tree start to decline, and perplexing when only half of the tree is showing signs of failure. Without photos or some more context of its location etc., my first thought jumps to root damage. Given the description, it sounds like it may be located near an area that receives foot, or even vehicle, traffic. The roots of trees can extend well beyond the drip line of the tree (which is the area under the outer edge of the crown of the tree). If the tree received heavy foot/vehicle traffic on one side, even beyond the drip line, over time that can impact the health of that tree. Also, if irrigation patterns change, mulch is applied/removed, other plants/grass is planted/removed, trails/buildings/driveways are constructed/altered within that root zone - these can all lead to root damage and visible signs of decline in the crown of the tree (e.g. no/dead foliage).   I recommend looking into each of these things and see what in the surrounding environment may have changed in the past few years, as that can help tell the story of why that tree is declining.    Here are a couple of resources that may be helpful as you look into this issue: -  Video: https://extension.oregonstate.edu/video/whats-wrong-my-tree - Publication: https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/sites/catalog/files/project/pdf/em8994.pdf\nUser: Thanks for the reply and additional information. We reapplied bark mulch this year as always. to my knowledge, there have been no disturbances to the root zone. I have attached some pictures I took.

Is there help available through OSU extension to those of us who live inCorvallis? Do you offer treatment?\nExpert: Hi, Peyton, You are correct that if you want your ash trees to survive, they will need to receive insecticide treatments (Emamectin Benzoate is the most effective) or soil drench. Both treatment options must be done by someone with a pesticide applicator's license. I did a quick search for folks with licenses in Corvallis and have linked the results below. I've heard estimates of about $2-300 per tree, but you'll have to consult with a contractor or pesticide applicator for an accurate quote. The injection, if done properly, lasts for up to 3 years.This document outlines treatment options nicely: https://www.oregon.gov/odf/forestbenefits/Documents/eab-treatment-fact-sheet_2024.pdfThis link shows Corvallis pesticide applicator license holders: https://mylicense.oda.state.or.us/ords/f?p=250:9:::NO:9:P9_PROGRAM:80Here are the results I get from the OR Forest Industry Directory when I search for insect specialists in Benton County:\nUser: Thank you for your prompt response.

Our grass also have some type of fungus through out, and unsure if this is related.\nExpert: Thank you for your question. I don’t think that any possible fungus in your yard is associated with this formation on your hackberry. We have been getting a fair number of questions so far this season dealing lawn fungus. We believe that this may be due to heavy, recent rainfalls. The foliage on the tree is puzzling to me. By any chance do you still have the plant label that came attached to the tree? Lacking that, if you know where you purchased the tree, might you be able to contact them and see what kind of records they have regarding the lineage of the tree. Specifically ask if your hackberry is a hybrid plant.  Lastly, have you ever done any pruning of the tree? I am trying to decide if its current appearance came after some pruning events, or if it developed naturally. For how many years has it looked like this? Looking forward to your responses. Thanks for using our forum.\nUser: This was planted as a young tree by the builders in a new development 5 years ago and they told us it was a hackberry but that's all the information I have on it. No pruning of the tree. Last year it did have the raised warts on the backs of most leaves. I believe it started last year but very mild and I didn't think much of it. This year is worse than last. More noticeable. On Mon, Jun 17, 2024, 6:15 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: Thanks for your response. I suspect that the “warts” you observed both last year and this year are attributable to mites known as hackberry Psyllids (Pachypsylla celtidismamma). They will not harm your hackberry and they can simply be ignored. More specifically these “warts” are called leaf galls. They have mite larvae within them. The adults of these insects are extremely small and hard to detect. See the following for images of the galls and the adults: https://bugguide.net/node/view/229821 https://bugguide.net/node/view/229829 Here’s the deal.  In spring 2023, adults of these insects emerged from places where they had overwintered during 2022-23. This could have been under pieces of bark or some other nook or cranny of the hackberry. These adults mated and females laid eggs on the leaves of your tree. Larvae quickly hatched. These larvae burrowed into the leaf tissue. The leaves responded by enclosing the larvae with a form of a leaf cancerous growth that is a type of defensive response. This led to the appearance of the bumps and nodules (galls) that you saw in 2023. These larvae developed into adults in late summer 2023. The adults went into hibernation for the winter 2023-24. When they emerged early this 2024 season, the process started all over again. See: https://extension.illinois.edu/blogs/garden-scoop/2019-07-25-hackberry-gall https://lancaster.unl.edu/pest/resources/hackberrypsyllids.shtml Going back to the shape of the hackberry, how long have you been noticing this shape?

The bare spots and unusual shape could be due to environmental factors such as soil conditions, water availability, or even genetic factors if the tree is a hybrid. Since the tree was planted by the builders, it might have been a young tree that was not pruned to encourage a specific shape. I recommend ensuring that the tree is receiving adequate water, especially during dry periods, and consider a soil test to check for any nutrient deficiencies.

I seem to mostly get on my all KBG side. I’ve only used certified weed seed after my reno, so not sure if it’s from the soil, animals, etc. But depending on what it is will depend on how I treat it. Also, my neighbor across street has a whole crap ton of it, so it might be the same thing and I could help him as well\nExpert: Grassy weed ID can be tricky due to small differences in physical features, especially from photos, but the traits we see suggest Orchardgrass, a common perennial cool-season grass. Management options are included in the linked page. Was any straw used to cover the seed last time the lawn was seeded/overseeded? Perhaps it had some weed seed, or as you suggested, maybe seeds blew-in from nearby yards if more Orchardgrass is growing there and its seed heads weren't mowed off before they matured.  Miri\nUser: No, I did not use any straw nor will I ever use any straw for that very reason. I did bring in a mixture of topsoil, sand, compost when I did my renovation, and I used the highest quality certified Bluegrass seed that Mountain View seeds makes. I used their 365ss blend.  ----------------------------------- Jason\nExpert: Ok, perhaps it seeded-in from another yard or open space, then, when mature Orchardgrass went to seed. For the future, if you aren't already, we suggest you consult with the recommended turfgrass cultivars publication (updated every summer) that lists which varieties of each turf type have performed best in Maryland conditions. Overseeding in autumn with those will help keep the lawn vigorous and dense enough to out-compete most weeds on its own. (High quality seed is good to use too of course, but depending on how customized that supplier's blend was for mid-Atlantic or \"transition zone\" climate, it might not include varieties well-suited to our challenging conditions. Typically, we suggest MD lawns be comprised of a majority tall fescue and very little Kentucky bluegrass, unless someone is willing to have a high-maintenance lawn.)  Miri\nUser: Well, fortunately, every single cultivar that I’ve used for fescue and Bluegrass are all on the proven list that you sent me below. Most of my turf is pretty thick, but the majority of where I have issues is around my tree where it doesn’t grow nearly as well and it’s really thin. I was wondering if adding dirt in that area would help grass be able to establish better.  CURRENT KBG GOOD AREA CURRENT KBG AROUND TREE ----------------------------------- Jason\nExpert: Great! We suspect the tree, both in terms of dappled shade and root competition, is what is causing thinning of the turf near it. Trees and turf don't mix over the long run (a healthy tree will win), so you might consider using fine fescue instead in that area, or replanting with alternative plantings (or just using mulch if you prefer). We would not suggest adding soil; too little won't do much, and too much (an inch or more) could either deprive the tree's roots of too much oxygen or cause them to grow more shallow as a result to compensate, worsening the issue with competition.  Miri\nUser: So, even if that area is lower than the rest of my yard, it wouldn’t be a good idea to even put any topsoil there to cover the roots that are surfacing and at the same time filling in that hole to level my yard? Asking because i obviously see top of roots and assume hard or impossible for grass to grow/survive very well there.  Also, you’re saying I could use my fescue just in that spot and would grow better than the KBG? ----------------------------------- Jason\nExpert: Correct, adding soil atop established tree roots is not a recommended practice unless there is drastic erosion, in which case you'd just be replacing what was lost and not adding more. (That isn't the case here.) Roots can be very sensitive to soil oxygen levels, and the deeper the soil, the less oxygen available to roots, which use it for respiration (essentially to \"breathe\" so they don't weaken and succumb to root rot pathogens). Even an added inch of soil might have detrimental impacts on plant roots. Tree roots can grow more shallowly when they aren't getting enough moisture or oxygen (usually the latter), since its more readily available at the soil surface, so compaction from frequent/regular foot traffic will encourage roots to grow closer to the surface. Some trees are more apt to do this than others, like maple (looks like the tree type pictured), birch, magnolia, and beech, but any can do so if stressed or in heavier soils that compact easily (like clay). With turfgrass, core-aeration every autumn or so can help to alleviate some compaction, but this would risk injuring too many roots to attempt over the root zone of a tree.  Kentucky Bluegrass is much more disease-prone in partial shade (powdery mildew, rust, leaf spot, root rot), in addition to simply being less shade-tolerant overall compared to tall fescue and fine fescue. (Seed mixes for full sun tend to be tall fescue; seed mixes for semi-shade tend to use mostly fine fescue.) Even those two turf types have their limits with regards to shade, but a few hours of direct sun during summer can be enough to keep them in halfway decent condition if you aren't able to replace the turf with other species. Fine fescue needs different care than tall fescue, though (much less mowing, for one), so using tall fescue if you already have some might be the most compatible with the care for the KY Bluegrass.  Miri\nUser: So tree roots can actually grow deeper or more shallow on their own? How does my other tree (Bradford pear) survive if I can’t even see its roots, which means they are covered by soil? ----------------------------------- Jason\nExpert: They can, but not once formed; that is, a two-inch-thick older root is not going to move shallower or deeper into the soil, but young growing tips of fine roots may wander up and down in the soil profile to find conditions that suit their needs. Seeking enough oxygen is one reason roots often develop in mulch \"volcanos\" (the way-too-much mulch piled against tree trunks that can be seen in many landscapes), since it's a dark environment that also gets a decent amount of oxygen. When the roots in that mulch run out of moisture, though, since mulch doesn't retain moisture to the same degree soil does, they can die off and stress a tree. Or, equally bad, they will circle around the trunk in that pocket of mulch, staying in the well-oxygenated zone, and as both the trunk and major roots increase in girth with age, the root \"strangles\" or girdles the trunk, eventually causing canopy dieback or even killing the entire tree.  It's normal to not see all surface roots on a tree (for example, the flowering pear). They can be covered with a few inches of soil if that's how they developed while they were growing. The vast majority of a tree's root system, regardless of tree species, will lie in the top foot or two of soil depth, radiating around the trunk outwards and reaching further out than the branches do (the edge of the canopy is called the \"drip line.\") The further out from the trunk, the finer the roots get, mirroring how branches form with thick bases attached to the trunk and smaller diameter the longer they grow. Some tree species simply have a predilection to growing shallow roots in more compacted or wet soils, so it's more likely a gardener will run into some surface-showing roots for maple, beech, etc., in yards with compacted soil conditions. In woods, where the soil is essentially undisturbed and not compacted from the house construction process and ongoing human foot traffic, the soil is much less compacted and tree roots don't need to react to lower-oxygen conditions by forming closer to the surface as they spread.  The inability of established tree roots to change position in the soil is the other reason why adding soil atop existing roots is not recommended -- they cannot compensate for the change in oxygen and moisture levels from added depth, so might suffocate (so to speak). Roots growing into the new soil after the fact, being new and still forming, can compensate by growing shallower again, into the soil layer with enough oxygen, but the original root they branch off of cannot move itself shallower.  It might help to think of it a bit like how branches on a tree or shrub canopy behave long-term if they get more light from one side than another, say due to an overhanging bigger tree or being crowded close to a wall or fence. The plant essentially leans into the more well-lit side, with branches preferentially growing in that direction to access the light they need. The roots do something similar -- in that analogy, the main branches aren't moving to get the light (they can't, they're too stiff with mature wood), but the leaves and new supple twig growth that they produce each season is what is changing the direction of growth (and for roots, their depth in the soil) over time to compensate for those changes in the plant's environment.  Miri\nUser: Thank you for answering my questions! I know I’m rambling and being a pest, but grass is one thing, but plants/trees is one I’m still learning about and don’t want to screw anything up. On topic of trees in regards to fertilization.1. Do I need to add extra fertilizer to the maple we were talking about if I’m already fertilizing the lawn around it as well as running my in ground irrigation (if so how much)?2. How much fertilizer should I add to my dwarf Japanese maple, which is now in its second full season. I have not directly added fertilizer to it as it sits alone by itself in my flower bed, which I’ve been working on redoing (so I don’t have any flowers or mulch yet) - I have no idea what to add. Thanks!On Wed, Apr 17, 2024 at 10:09 AM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: Hi, Cameron,  No, a tree surrounded by lawn that is fertilized will rarely need fertilizer of its own. Even if it were to show symptoms of nutrient deficiency, contributing factors like root damage or improper pH (soil acidity) would need to be ruled-out first, since they would be a more likely cause. Only a laboratory soil test can determine if any key nutrients are deficient, and they also screen for pH level with more accuracy than a home soil testing kit or probe. Even if the tree weren't surrounded by lawn, fertilizer is usually not needed for established plants. (The soil usually has all the nutrients they need to support growth at its normal pace. Trying to force extra or faster growth with a nutrient boost can backfire by resulting in weaker (less sturdy) stems or a greater vulnerability to pest outbreaks or infection.)  As with the other tree, the Japanese maple should not need any fertilizer. Gardeners tend to think of fertilizers (and they are marketed this way, so we don't blame them) as plant \"food,\" but that is not really accurate. Sunlight is more akin to plant food, and the nutrients they absorb from the soil support photosynthesis and growth. Fertilizer would be more of a supplemental multivitamin, filling-in for nutrients that are missing from a plant's \"diet\" (if the soil were deficient), but it cannot fuel growth directly without adequate other resources (sun, soil moisture, stored carbohydrates in the plant's tissues, etc.) and it cannot cure an ailing plant.  One of the better tactics to protect long-term plant health is to make sure trees are planted at the proper depth. We see what looks like the graft union swelling on the base of the J. maple trunk -- a normal feature that most will have because cultivars are usually grafted -- but can't make out enough detail to find the root flare. The flare is where major roots branch off of the trunk base, and it should sit just at the soil surface, visible and not buried by soil or too much mulch. You can learn more about how vital this region of tree structure is for root health in the linked page. Young trees don't always have an obvious flare as the structure's name implies, but it will still have that root junction that needs siting at the correct depth, and the flare itself develops over time as it ages. Keep it free of mulch and only put down mulch in a flat, even layer no thicker than 3 inches over the rest of the root zone. You can add companion plants if you prefer, but avoid putting in annuals that require yearly replanting since this repeated digging into the maple's root zone may cause damage or plant stress in future years. Perennials that don't need replanting because they live for many years are the better option in that regard.  Miri\nUser: I had no idea about any of that with the trees and as of recently just learned about putting mulch in a “volcano.”    As far as pH my lawn is around 6.8-7.0 and am not deficient in any of my macronutrients. Not sure exactly what it is in the flower bed as I’ve never tested that before.    Here’s a better look at my trees roots. First image will be the Japanese maple, which I planted and the bigger maple was here when I moved in 2020 (but house was built in 2005, so guessing it was planted then).   JAPANESE MAPLE IN FLOWER BED  ORIGINAL MAPLE IN TREATED YARD  ----------------------------------- Jason\nExpert: We didn't receive the second photo for some reason, but for the J. maple, we can't quite tell if the bulge is the top of the root flare, a graft union, or a portion of a girdling root that developed when the tree was younger (before it was sold, probably). You might want to gently excavate more to see if you can find a clearer root junction. If not, this depth may have to suffice, as long as mulch isn't put over top of it (the trunk base that is, the rest of the root zone is fine to mulch).  That lawn pH is fine as-is, though slightly lower might be ideal (no need to try changing it at this point, since it's still within the acceptable range).  Miri\nUser: Not sure why the other picture didn’t come through, but these are the pictures of the maple in my front yard.      ----------------------------------- Jason"

What is the best mixture for soil?\nI have heard equal parts \nperlite\ncompost\npeat moss\n\nwould like your recommendation\nExpert: Hi, Reese depends on the type of flowers you plan on growing. Are they annuals? Do they thrive in rich fertile soils or more pore or well draining soil? Something like lavender wouldn't want the potting mix to be very wet where as if you had a dryer mix with more pore space, a plant like Begonias might wilt and dry out too much.  You can explore our webpage on  soil for raised bed gardening. If you are building up the bed on the existing ground, you could get a laboratory soil test done to see what nutrients are in the existing soil. If you are referring to more of a container raised bed then you can read our Growing media for containers.  We are encouraging gardeners to try to seek other sources for peat moss. The problem with peat is three-fold: stripping off peat from peatlands disturbs complex ecosystems; excavation releases enormous amounts of CO2, a major greenhouse gas driving climate change; and demand for peat-based soilless media is growing. You can read more about it on the link for a blog post article.  Perlite will add poor space to the mix which helps with drainage in a container and compost will aid in nutrients and add organic matter for the plants to thrive. You can either seek sources for each of these to mix with a peat moss replacement to do your own blend, or sometimes potting mixes for containers already contain a good balance of these. You should read the bags for see if the label explains 'peat free' - if it lists coconut coir then that would work, but if it says 'other forest products' it could mean that peat moss is still in there just at a different percentage.  If you are building up a raised bed on existing ground, you could just add some compost to the existing soil and that should be enough to make a fertile planting area for most flower types. If you have further questions or would like to ask for certain flowers, then feel free to continue to reach out.   Emily\nUser: Hi, Emerson,Thanks so much for your quick response. I will use coconut coir instead of the peat moss. I will have dahlia’s , zinnias, celosia, snapdragons,cosmos. I will be putting down cardboard where the raised bed will be, so I will be starting fresh with soil. So I’m wondering what ratio to use with the compost, coir and perlite. Thanks so much for your help!!!best, Beth   On Mar 23, 2023, at 2:03 PM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: Hi, Elliot,  That sounds lovely! On our Soil to Fill Raised Beds webpage, you could do a combination of 'Scenario 1&2' . The perlite and coconut coir aren't really necessary since you are building up the raised bed on the ground. Perlite on the ground will end up blowing away or washing away with heavy rains. Doing a mix of topsoil and compost would be sufficient and the organic matter will add pore space and help break up compacted or clay soil underneath. (Coconut coir and or peat moss can be expensive too). Depending on the size of the garden bed, you can get a load delivered of compost (or leafgro - a product name sold in Maryland which is decomposed leaf litter and yard waste), and top soil and mix via wheel borough load. It might be more economical for you.  Since you want to plant this season, you may want to use newspaper instead of carboard, so it breaks down and adds drainage faster. Or you can just pile the soil and compost mix right on top of the existing ground and if it is thick enough, you don't need the barrier. You can take a garden fork and gently rock in the soil to break up the ground before putting anything down. The ratio listed on the link is 1:1 mix. If you thought it would help to mix in coconut coir, you could, but we feel like it isn't necessary for the cost. If you do mixing in 1/3 of each would work and even a little less on the coconut coir would be fine too.  Just be sure to use mulch after seedlings or transplants are in to help cut down on weed germination from seeds that get dispersed through air or wildlife. Let us know if you have more questions with this. Happy planting!\nUser: Thank you so much for all your help!! I finished and used Leafgrow and topsoil .

Wire grass can indeed be a persistent issue.

This can help suppress the growth of wire grass by blocking sunlight and making it harder for the grass to establish.\\n\\n3. **Regular Maintenance**: Keep an eye on the edges of your bed and remove any wire grass that starts to encroach. Regularly pulling out the grass can help prevent it from spreading.\\n\\n4. **Herbicides**: As a last resort, you can use a selective herbicide that targets grasses, but be cautious as it may affect your flowers as well.\\n\\n5. **Soil Solarization**: If you haven't planted yet, you could try soil solarization by covering the area with clear plastic for a few weeks to kill off the grass.\\n\\nLet me know if you need more detailed advice on any of these methods.

We have 4 smaller fruit trees in a large concrete patio area in the front of the building.  Each tree is in a bed about 4X8 feet.  Back in 2017 the landscape designer used what we believe is grey crusher fines/gray Breeze to mulch the trees.  The mulch has worn down and we want to replace it for moisture retention.  Off to the side of the large patio is another large area with a couple of smaller trees and that whole area is mulched with the same grey crusher fines material. This mulch also needs to be replenished.  \n\nWe are assuming that replenishing these mulched areas with crusher fines would be best, but I have not been able to find much on line regarding using crusher fines for mulching small trees.  Does this sound reasonable?  We have other beds around the building that are planted with shrubs, grasses and perennials and mulched with Gorilla Hair Mulch but we believe the crusher fines are better when surrounded by concrete patio or covering a large area that is heavily trafficked.\n\nDo you agree that crusher fines are appropriate for mulching these patio trees?  Since is is pretty dense, would one inch be sufficient?  Not sure if the beds are deep enough for more than an inch and a half or maybe two inches of mulch.  \n\nThanks so much for your guidance!\nHazel"

(Prefer to do this versus watering area myself).\nExpert: Good afternoon and thank you for your question.  Unfortunately, I cannot confirm from the photos alone that you are dealing with white grubs.  Can you please roll back the turf and provide a photo so I can get an idea of the white grub populations you are experiencing.    If it is grubs, it is likely too late to get this product down and taken up into the plant.  Because it is a systemic insecticide, it could take over two weeks to get taken up into the plant and be effective. Possibly even longer with the drought we have been experiencing and since the grass is not actively growing, the function of the phloem and xylem has slowed way down. Waiting for rain would even delay the process even further.  Typically at this time of year, we also also dealing with third instar larvae (the largest and final larval stage) present in the soil. It is recommended that the application is made prior to the third instar grub due to the fact that they stop feeding and descend into the soil as winter approaches.  This insecticide is much more effective when applied as a preventative verses a curative.   Once I see the photo, I can better guide you.  Thank you again for your question.

Based on what you've described and the images, it seems like the tree is experiencing some stress, possibly from a combination of past pest damage and environmental factors. The old wounds on the bark could indeed be from previous squirrel activity, even if you haven't observed it recently. The significant dieback on the east side might be due to environmental stressors or past pest damage, such as the Japanese beetle infestation you mentioned. Here are a few steps you can take to help your tree recover and prevent further issues:\\n\\n1. **Monitor for Pests:** Continue to monitor for pests like Japanese beetles and apply treatments as needed. Neem oil and other organic treatments can be effective if applied consistently.\\n\\n2. **Pruning:** Ensure that any dead or diseased wood is pruned out to prevent the spread of disease and to encourage healthy growth.\\n\\n3. **Watering and Mulching:** Make sure the tree is receiving adequate water, especially during dry spells. Mulching around the base can help retain moisture and regulate soil temperature.\\n\\n4. **Fertilization:** Consider applying a balanced fertilizer in the spring to support new growth.\\n\\n5. **Regular Inspection:** Keep an eye on the tree for any new symptoms or changes, and feel free to reach out if you notice anything concerning.\\n\\nThese steps should help improve the overall health of your apple tree. If the problem persists or worsens, consulting with a local arborist might be beneficial for a more detailed assessment.\"}"

I recommend checking the drainage of the area and ensuring that the soil is not waterlogged. You might want to reduce the frequency of watering, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. Additionally, inspect the roots for any signs of rot when you pull up the bushes. If the roots are mushy or blackened, it indicates root rot. In that case, you may need to improve drainage or consider replanting in a better-drained location.

I’m surprised at the number of dead leaves on the ground for this time of year. Could it have been affected by the month or so in May/June with no rain?  Should I supplementally water in those times? Could the underplantings be a problem? Those gardens were added in the last 2 years.  \n\n2. One of my leucothoe doghobble shrubs is showing yellowing with deep green veins. Otherwise still healthy and putting in new growth to match its mates. 3 are planted together. \n\nPhotos:\n1: Kousa with yellowing, dying, and also green veining\n\n2. Close up of leucothoe\n\n3. Photo of all 3 leucothoe\n\nThank you for your help!\nExpert: Hi, Jordan Dogwood looks like it has some chlorosis symptoms which can be typical this time of year with the heat. Those appear to be the old leaves though and look like the new growth is healthy. You can monitor for water as much of Maryland is still in drought like conditions. If the dogwood doesn't show much of a rebound later this fall, you may want to do a soil sample and see how the pH and soil nutrients are. Or you could pro-actively do that now. It looks like there is turf around there and if you have limed it often or recently, that could be part of the cause as Dogwoods prefer more acidic soil generally.  The Leucothoe has some chlorotic symptoms as well, but over all appears to be really healthy! Sometimes those plants can be a little finicky but yours looks good! With it being close to the foundation, you may want to test the soil there as well to make sure it is acidic enough for the plants desirable conditions. If the discolored foliage is bothersome, you can prune it out of the plant as the leaves won't 'repair' themselves.  Let us know if you have further questions or if you choose to do the soil analysis, we can help you read and interpret the results.  Emily\nUser: Dear, Emerson, Thank you for this helpful response!  I was wondering if it was chlorosis.  If I do a soil sample and find the nutrients are low.  What are the healthy nutrients to add for chlorosis?  Something like Iron Tone?  Also, I've heard good things about SuperThrive.I'm curious, is this something that could threaten the Kousa's life in just one year, or since it is so established do you think it will rebound next year?  I will do some infrequent deep waterings of the Kousa for the rest of the summer.  The leaves with chlorosis continue to yellow, die, and fall off.  The Leucothoe still looks happy and hasn't deteriorated any further.Gratefully,JessicaOn Fri, Jul 21, 2023 at 1:01 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

SuperThrive is a vitamin solution that can help reduce plant stress and promote growth, but it doesn't specifically address nutrient deficiencies like iron. As for the Kousa dogwood, since it is well-established, it is likely to rebound next year if the underlying issues are addressed. Chlorosis can be a sign of stress, but it typically doesn't threaten the life of an established tree in just one year. Continue with your plan for infrequent deep watering, and consider applying a suitable iron supplement if needed based on your soil test results.

First, consider using Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), a natural bacterium that targets caterpillars without harming beneficial insects. Apply it in the early spring when caterpillars are young and more susceptible. Additionally, inspect your plants regularly for caterpillars and remove them by hand if possible. Pruning the damaged parts can help the plant focus its energy on new growth, but avoid cutting it all the way back unless the damage is severe. Ensure your plants are healthy by providing adequate water and nutrients, as strong plants are more resilient to pests. Finally, consider using row covers or netting to physically block caterpillars from reaching the plants.\"}"

As for replanting in the same space, it's generally a good idea to rotate crops to prevent the buildup of soil-borne diseases. Since you're planning to switch to a different cut flower crop, this should help mitigate some risks.

It still appears to have good top growth though so it could be from the heat and drought (unusual since it tends to do better in dry soils and full sun), or perhaps the mulch is too deep or soil too rich? Try to pull back the mulch and expose the root crown a little more. From personal experience it seems like the 'Blue Ice' variety has more of an exposed root crown that sends out runners and is rhizomatous as opposed to the taproot fiburous root system of the straight species. Maybe it is buried by a little too mulch or planted a little too deeply. Is it a newer planting? Have you noticed this before? Since its the end of the season we would suggest to just let it go. It doesn't appear to be a disease or insect issue so no need to cut back or clean up the foliage now.

If we prune it all back to about 2 feet, will it be bushy and vigorous again?\nExpert: When you do that amount of drastic pruning, the oldest stems should have been cut to the ground to encourage new ones.  Leaving 6 inches only encouraged it to branch out giving you what you see now.  When leaves drop this fall and you are able to see the shape of the shrub, you can prune off the stems that have branched out so far.  Then shape it by pruning back the side branching to an acceptable form.  Or, you can cut the entire shrub to the ground and have all new growth next spring.\nUser: so, are re-reading your response and still puzzling over best way to proceed after leaves are dropped.  If all the stems that have branched out so far are all that is left of the shrub, then we cut it all back down to the ground.  And if there are still some up-right stems left, we trim off the side branches of those to encourage a more upright form?  I can't tell you how many classes we've taken on pruning & it just escapes us!  You guys should hire out as pruners!"

After the leaves drop, you have a couple of options. If the shrub is mostly made up of stems that have branched out too far, cutting it back to the ground will encourage new, vigorous growth in the spring. This method is often referred to as rejuvenation pruning. If there are still some upright stems that you want to keep, you can trim off the side branches to encourage a more upright form. This selective pruning will help maintain the structure you desire.

It seemed okay throughout the remainder of the summer. This spring it is not budding and holding onto the dead helicopter leaves. We’re concerned (and very sad)\nExpert: Hi, Skyler,   Don't give up on the tree yet! Sometimes ash trees will get a slow start, especially after extreme weather. Ash trees in general have had a tough time the last 5+ years. I would give the tree this entire season, and see how it goes. Monitor any growth you see over the summer.  A few things to keep in mind:Consider reaching out to a certified arborist to assess the tree for hazard risk (more branches breaking, etc.). You can find certified arborists here: https://www.treesaregood.org/ We recommend receiving 2 or 3 assessments. Make sure to provide supplemental water to your tree all-year around. More info here and here. This is the best thing you can do for your tree!Based on your photos, it appears there may be a lot of activity under the tree? Noticing the lawn chairs, hammock, etc. Activity under trees can be hard on trees over time. The soil and roots have likely been compacted over time. This could lead to long-term damage to the tree's health. Consider adding a fresh layer of mulch, removing the rocks at the base of the tree, and limiting foot traffic underneath the tree. If you add mulch, be sure to keep the first 6-inches from the base of the tree free of mulch (just bare soil) to avoid moisture issues on the trunk of the tree.Keep an eye on the hammock and the swing. Over time, things like hammocks can actually damage the cambium (growing layer of cells underneath the bark). The tree grows outward, so if the hammock is tight on the tree for years, you'll start to notice the trunk grow around the hammock strap. This will impact the trees health. Consider removing hammocks during the fall/winter, or any long periods when the hammock is not being used.  Let us know if you have any questions! You can also email us at <personal data hidden>, or my email at <personal data hidden>.   Kind regards,  Lisa  Lisa Mason Horticulture Specialist Colorado State University Extension, Arapahoe County\nUser: This was so helpful! I appreciate you taking the time to provide such great advice and explanations!"

I recommend closely inspecting the trunk and branches for any small holes or signs of insect activity. If you confirm a borer infestation, you may need to apply an appropriate insecticide or consult with a local arborist for treatment options. Additionally, ensure that the tree is not stressed by environmental factors. Although you received a good amount of rain, the tree might benefit from supplemental watering during dry spells, especially given its age.

You can move them to pen 1, the 2-acre pasture grass field, after the frost. Monitor their health and the condition of the pasture. Generally, goats can stay in a pasture for about 4-6 weeks before needing to be rotated to another area, depending on the pasture's condition and the number of goats. Ensure that the new pasture has been vacant for at least a couple of months to reduce the risk of parasite transmission.

Since you have a pH meter and strips, testing the soil pH is a good first step. Ideally, horse chestnut trees prefer slightly acidic to neutral soil (pH 6.0-7.0). If the pH is too high, it can lead to nutrient lockout. If chlorosis is confirmed, you might consider applying a chelated iron supplement to the soil or as a foliar spray. Additionally, ensure that the trees are receiving adequate water, especially during dry spells, as clay soil can sometimes impede proper drainage. Regular mulching can help retain soil moisture and improve soil structure over time. If you have further questions or need more detailed guidance, feel free to reach out.\"}"

To manage this, you should prune out the affected branches, making sure to sterilize your pruning tools between cuts to prevent spreading the disease. Ensure good air circulation around the plants by thinning out dense growth and avoid overhead watering to reduce moisture on the leaves. If the problem persists, you might consider applying a fungicide labeled for Volutella blight. Keep monitoring the plants closely and maintain good cultural practices to prevent further spread.\"}"

The fact that the roots have not expanded beyond the initial root ball suggests that the plant may be experiencing root binding or poor root development, which can be exacerbated by compacted soil or insufficient aeration. The white mold-like substance you observed could be a type of beneficial fungus, but it could also indicate poor soil conditions if it's excessive. The change in leaf color could be a sign of nutrient deficiency or stress, possibly related to the recent pH adjustment. Blueberries prefer a more acidic soil, ideally between 4.5 and 5.5, so a pH of 6.5 might still be too high for optimal growth. I recommend testing the soil pH again and considering further acidification if necessary. Additionally, ensure that the soil is well-aerated and not compacted, and consider adding organic matter to improve soil structure.

Secondly, the rose might be experiencing stress from the transition between the garage and outdoor conditions. Gradually acclimate the plant to outdoor conditions in the spring to reduce shock. Additionally, while you are using a rose-specific fertilizer, ensure it is applied according to the package instructions and consider supplementing with a balanced fertilizer to support overall plant health. Lastly, the lack of blooms could be due to the plant's age or root-bound conditions in the pot. Ensure the pot size is adequate for root growth, and consider repotting if necessary. Regular pruning is also essential to encourage blooming, so resume this practice. If these adjustments do not lead to blooms, consider consulting a local extension service for further soil and climate-specific advice.\"}"

Since you've already removed the distal portions of the snapped branches, you can now focus on shaping the plant. After blooming, it's a good time to prune lilacs. Start by removing any dead or damaged wood completely. For the taller central branches that have snapped, you can cut them back to a healthy lateral branch or to the main stem to encourage new growth. To promote lower branching, consider cutting back some of the taller branches to just above a node where you want new growth to emerge. This will help in filling out the center and encouraging growth near the ground. Regularly monitor the plant for any new shoots and guide them to fill in the desired areas.

Please describe for us the life of these trees.  When and how were they planted?  Is this the first year you noticed the problem?  How do the trees receive moisture?  If from an automated irrigation system, how often and how much are they watered?  Do you water over the winter in dry years? Have any herbicides or pesticides been used on other plants but in the vicinity of the trees within the last two years (including by neighbors or open space crews) where the chemicals may have drifted onto the trees?  Have any ground-applied chemicals such as lawn weed killers been used near the trees in the last two years?  Has there been any construction that might have damaged roots?  Once we hear back from you, we may have additional questions but this will give us a good start.  Thank you for contacting us. Jeffco Clinician Annette\nUser: The trees are about 15 years old. Our  tree service has always deep root watered the tress during the winter months. In the summer they are irrigated by drip system approximately 4 gallons per setting  3 days per week and also get hit with some  water from the lawn sprinkling system. There has been no noxious chemicals used on or near the trees. They do receive regular insecticide/foliage sprays by Davey Tree during the summer months. We have 4 of the autumn blaze maples in the backyard. The one tree is in the grass area and is watered only by the lawn sprinkler system. All 4 tress have the same lower branch dying problem. The trees have been looked at by 2 Davey Tree arborists and they have no idea what the problem is. I am attaching pictures but am not sure they are exactly what you want. You can let me know if you want something different.  I have 12 pictures but cannot get them to all load. I will send them in batches."

Additionally, while they can tolerate full sun, they may need some protection from harsh winter winds, which could be a concern in your area.\\n\\nAs for your preferences, Yoshino cherry trees can grow up to 20-30 feet tall, which might be taller than what you're looking for. They also can be somewhat messy when the blossoms fall, although they do not require much pruning.\\n\\nConsidering your criteria, a redbud (Cercis canadensis) could be a great alternative. Redbuds are native to the eastern United States, including Maryland, and are well-suited to your climate. They are smaller, typically growing to about 20-30 feet, and are known for their beautiful spring flowers and heart-shaped leaves.

The switch from drip irrigation to a soaker hose might have altered the water distribution, leading to under-watering, especially at the base of the trees. It's good that you are now soaking them daily, as consistent and adequate watering is crucial. Ensure that the water is penetrating deeply to reach the roots. As for fertilization, junipers generally do not require much fertilizer, but a balanced, slow-release fertilizer can be applied in early spring if needed. However, avoid over-fertilizing, as this can cause more harm than good. Since the fence is to the east, it might be causing some shading, but since the trees are thriving elsewhere, this is less likely the primary issue. Keep an eye on the trees for any signs of pests or disease, but from your description, it seems more related to watering. Continue monitoring the trees and adjust watering as needed.

See attached picture\nExpert: From a distance it is clear that the plants are stressed but it is difficult to say why.  The spotting is a common disease called 'shothole', but it doesn't look terribly concerning.  We can't see signs of a scale pest that can bother them, but become aware of it and keep an eye out:  https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/PlantFinder/PlantFinderDetails.aspx?taxonid=252685&isprofile=1&basic=cherry%20laurel The yellowing looks more concerning and makes us suspect a root issue. When did it begin and do you notice any pattern to which ones are yellowing?  Is the soil drainage o.k.? These plants like moist but well-drained soil and will not stand for wet roots.  Were they planted within the last couple of years, and how were they cared for/watered afterward? When planted, were they rootbound, or was a burlap cover left on? (Even some potted ones can have a burlap sheath and sometimes what looks like burlap can have plastic netting embedded in it.)  We can't tell what variety you have there but cherry laurel can get pretty large. While even the compact, dwarf cultivars like  'Otto Luyken' grow to only 3-4 feet tall, they can tend to grow as wide as 6-8 feet and yours look a good deal closer than 3 feet apart.

Since these plants were planted in Fall 2020, they should be well-established by now, but if they were planted with burlap or in compacted soil, this could still be affecting their health. I recommend checking the soil drainage and considering amending the soil with organic matter to improve its quality. Mulching can also help protect the roots from temperature fluctuations. If the problem persists, a soil test might be beneficial to determine if there are any nutrient deficiencies or pH imbalances. Regular monitoring for pests and diseases is also advised.

The salesman told me I should use this water bag to water the tree, as it does a much better job than a hose. He said if you run the water too fast, it will disrupt the soil around the tree. (Really? I've run the hose on tiny shoots in my vegetable garden and they grew fine.) And if you run it too slow, it will, of course, take a long time to water. What's the scoop? Is this a useful product or just a gimmick? Also, this bag is made of plastic, and being the tree-hugging (joke intended), earth loving guy that I am, I am trying to use as little plastic as possible. I have the receipt and the packaging is unopened, so I can return it if I want to. Also, can you provide instructions on how often to water this tree?\nExpert: Making sure that the tree is well planted and cared for afterwards is important for establishment and long term success. While I know you won't be doing the actual planting, it's worth reading through our page on planting: https://extension.umd.edu/resource/planting-tree-or-shrub/, particularly in relation to planting depth- you want to be able to see the root flare before it goes into the ground/mulch. (Mulch should be no deeper than 2-4 inches and kept pulled back from contact with the trunk).  The water bags are not a gimmick, but are useful for people who won't/can't  water their trees for some reason.  Here is our page on Watering Trees and Shrubs:  https://extension.umd.edu/resource/watering-trees-and-shrubs/  Keeping an eye on your new tree and watering when needed is important for the first 24 months of establishment. Unpredictable/changing climate conditions makes this even more important as the last few years have had periods of prolonged drought, heat-stress as well as deluges of rain.  Red maples are gorgeous native trees.  The Marylander's Plant Trees program offers a $25 off coupon for select native trees at participating nurseries. It may be too late to use the coupon but it wouldn't hurt to ask.... or get another tree! You can find the link for it within this page about halfway down:  https://extension.umd.edu/resource/planting-trees-our-changing-climate/   Christine\nUser: My yard is clay soil. I just read about the test for drainage, but from past experience with similar experiments I have done, I think it will fail the test. How will the red maple fair in this soil and in direct sunlight all day?\nUser: I'm reading on the internet that it needs Soil Type Sandy, clay, well-drained\nUser: I'm looking to replace a Norway maple that died at 60 years old. I want something that will provide shade to my home in the summer and block the wind in the winter. I prefer a fast growing tree. What do you recommend?  Sounds like the red maple is not going to thrive in my clay soil.\nExpert: Clay in soil is not a bad thing and most of our soils central in Maryland (Piedmont region) have a good amount of clay, which helps it hold moisture.  Go ahead and do the test for drainage. It's likely that you are fine.   The natural habitat for our native Red Maples includes moist and wet conditions including swamps, as well as \"uplands, rocky hillsides and dunes\" so they can do well in all conditions. They like full to part sun. I have a line of six mature (30 year old) Acer rubrum up my driveway- the area where they are planted gets a lot of water. The biggest issue to watch for is girdling roots, to which they are prone but can be common with trees that have circling root within the pot/root ball. They can develop over time as well but if you can see the root flare where the roots radiate out you can (in future years) clip any young ones that begin to cross others. We have a Maryland Grows blog post from earlier this year that does a great job of explaining this:  https://marylandgrows.umd.edu/2024/01/12/free-the-flare-maintain-visible-root-flare-for-tree-health/   Christine\nUser: After reading this material, I don't think I'm ready for this tree. I have not had the soil tested. I think takes a couple weeks to get test results from University Of Delaware. I've used them to test my vegetable bed. I also do not have time before the tree arrives to:  improve the soil over as much of the future root area as possible.  Although I guess I could ask them to delay delivery.  I'd have to buy a garden fork and aerate the ground. The area where the tree should be planted is all grass, so it sounds like that's bad too. I think I have until tomorrow to get a refund on the tree. I'll check the results of the soil drainage test this evening at 6:30 pm.\nExpert: As you may recall from the vegetable bed testing, laboratory soil testing, like from the University of Delaware, won't be evaluating drainage, but will provide a report on nutrient levels, acidity (pH), and organic matter percentage. These won't prevent the tree from being planted, but can inform you as to any fertilizer that might be needed (not likely, as most soils are not markedly deficient in any key nutrients) or any minor adjustments to pH that would help a maple thrive. (Again, adjusting pH is usually not needed, especially for locally-native tree species.)  The soil \"improvement,\" if it's needed at all (again, clay is fine, and what Red Maple in the wild here often grows in), will take place at the time of planting, and while it could take place any amount of time beforehand, that is not necessary. All improvement would entail is potentially adding some organic matter (compost or good-quality topsoil at most) to the soil removed from the planting hole and blending it together. The reason either source of organic matter is used is because it helps clay soil resist compaction and improve drainage. If you will be mulching around the base of the tree, that is also organic matter that will decay into more compost that improves the root zone soil texture gradually over time. (If you prefer to grow decorative groundcovers around its base instead, that too is fine and still beneficial.)  Lawn grasses will eventually be out-competed by a healthy tree, since the roots and shade it casts will deprive it of resources, but that is some years down the road, even with as fast as Red Maple can grow. Any fertilizer used on the lawn will also benefit the tree, but as the tree grows, avoid putting any lime down on the area of lawn that might still remain in its root zone, since lime raises pH and maples prefer a lower pH.  Red Maples are very commonly used in all sorts of landscaping (around homes, commercial settings, and as street trees, the latter of which are among the most stressful locations), where they usually do well, even if close to or surrounded by turfgrass. They are also frequently used in stormwater swales, where the root zone can flood by one or more feet of water during heavy rain events, which might not fully drain away for several days, and they do just fine. As Christine mentioned, the key for long-term health for any tree species is to make sure that root flare is situated at the soil surface, rather than being buried under a few inches of soil and/or mulch. Even if you decide to plant a different tree in this or another location, this will be an important step for planting it properly. Not all nursery/landscaping installers are trained well enough to be aware of this, so that's why she shared the web page that you can look over, to see if they check on root flare depth instead of just planting the tree at the depth it was growing in the pot or root ball.  Late summer (now) into mid-autumn is an excellent time to plant trees (even better than spring in most cases), but if you don't feel ready for it, that's fine. One adage in the horticulture industry, when we're asked about the best time to plant, is that someone should plant when they're ready (including ready to take care of the plant once it's in the ground, mainly through monitoring it for watering needs). The Marylanders Plant Trees rebate program has been in place for many years now, so that will likely still be available into the foreseeable future if you either postpone this planting or add other native trees in the future.

Ideally, for most trees, including red maples, you would want the water to drain within 24 hours. Since you have 5 inches of water remaining after 8 hours, it suggests that the drainage is not too poor, but it is not optimal either. Red maples can tolerate a range of soil conditions, including those with slower drainage, so your site should be suitable for planting. However, to improve conditions, you might consider adding organic matter to the soil to enhance drainage and aeration. This can be done by mixing compost into the soil at the time of planting. Keep an eye on the tree's water needs, especially during the establishment period, and adjust watering as necessary to prevent waterlogging.\"}"

Now I'm troubleshooting moving the cuttings from perlite into soil. I planted one small cutting in the ground (that looks sad/wilted now, maybe too much sun/water) and one in a small pot. The potted one is getting brown spots on the leaves, thinking that's a bad sign (stem rot?). I have a small handful left to try. \n\nSo, I'm wondering if anyone has recommendations for how to transfer these plants successfully into pots and/or the ground? My theory is maybe less water in the soil? Or the wrong type? I used a potting mix in the small pot. And/or not enough humidity. Wondering if I should cut the leaves in half and/or go heavier on the sand/perlite and lighter on the water and then plant it in shade? Or should I keep the re-potted cuttings inside (in a humidity dome?) until they're bigger - or at least showing signs of growth? - and only bottom water. \n\nMy ultimate goal is to have a female plant in the yard to go with the male I already have to provide fruit for the birds some day! And cuttings for friends. I wish nurseries sold female plants too and not just the showy males. :)\n\nThanks for any help!"

Here are some steps you can take to manage the situation:\\n\\n1. **Pruning and Disposal**: Prune the blackened and heavily infested branches. Dispose of them by burning or bagging and removing them from your property to prevent further spread of pests.\\n\\n2. **Soil and Ground Management**: While aphids and scale typically overwinter on the plant itself, some pests can overwinter in the soil. Consider applying a horticultural oil or insecticidal soap to the soil surface in late winter or early spring to target any overwintering pests.\\n\\n3. **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**: Implement an IPM approach by encouraging natural predators like ladybugs and lacewings, which can help control aphid populations. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm beneficial insects.\\n\\n4. **Pesticide Selection**: Since you've tried various pesticides without success, consider using systemic insecticides that are absorbed by the plant and target pests feeding on it. Products containing imidacloprid can be effective against scale and aphids.\\n\\n5. **Regular Monitoring**: Regularly inspect your trees for early signs of infestation and treat promptly. This can prevent the problem from escalating.\\n\\n6. **Cultural Practices**: Ensure your Crapemyrtles are not stressed by drought or poor nutrition, as healthy plants are more resistant to pests.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you should be able to manage the pest problem more effectively. If the issue persists, consider consulting with a local extension service for more tailored advice.\"}"

If you want to talk to a master gardener in person, look for events where Anoka County Master Gardeners are answering questions. Here's their page: https://anokamastergardeners.org/ My suspicion is that plants were somehow infected with a leaf spot and the excessive rain helped it run wild. Peppers want heat, and we haven't had much of it this year. This may be bacterial leaf spot, which thrives in wet, humid weather.  https://extension.umn.edu/disease-management/bacterial-spot-tomato-and-pepper It would be wise to discard infected plants to save the rest. If you want to save plants that are mildly affected, pull off and bag the bad leaves and put them in the garbage. Also remove any dead leaves from the area.  I hope this helps.

First, check the soil moisture regularly by sticking your finger about an inch into the soil; if it feels dry, it's time to water. For raised beds, they tend to dry out faster than in-ground gardens, so they may require more frequent checks. Ensure that your plants are getting deep, infrequent watering rather than shallow, frequent watering to encourage deep root growth. Mulching can help retain soil moisture and reduce the need for frequent watering. Additionally, consider using a drip irrigation system or soaker hoses to provide consistent moisture directly to the roots. For zucchinis, soft and hollow ends can also be a sign of blossom end rot, which is often caused by calcium deficiency, so ensure your soil has adequate nutrients. Adjust your watering schedule based on weather conditions, as hot, dry weather will require more water than cooler, wet conditions.\"}"

Since the bark damage does not go completely around the trunk, the tree still has a good chance of recovery.

Make sure to use a breathable wrap to prevent moisture buildup, which can lead to rot.\\n\\n2. **Wound Care**: Avoid using any sealants or wound dressings, as these can sometimes do more harm than good by trapping moisture and pathogens.\\n\\n3. **Monitor the Tree**: Keep an eye on the tree for signs of stress or disease. Ensure it is getting adequate water, especially during dry periods, but be careful not to overwater.\\n\\n4. **Fertilization**: Consider applying a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in the spring to support the tree's recovery and growth.\\n\\n5. **Professional Assessment**: If the damage appears severe or if you're unsure about the tree's recovery, consulting with a certified arborist could provide additional guidance.\\n\\nBy taking these steps, you can help your river birch recover from the deer damage.

Additionally, continue manually removing the caterpillars as you have been doing. Monitoring the tree regularly for any new infestations will also help in managing the situation. As for the survival of the larch, if the tree is otherwise healthy and you manage to control the caterpillars soon, it should recover.

What is wrong with it?\nExpert: Hi, Jordan seed pods turning black are normal after the flowers have bloomed and they begin to dry. I have always thought of them as little rattles because you can hear the seeds inside when you shake them.  The leaves look like they may have powdery mildew on them. Is this on the north or east side of the house? Baptisia should be in mostly sun conditions. Do you water overhead? These probably don't need to be irrigated much unless you just planted them this year. If you do need to supplement water, try to water at the base and not get the leaves wet.  Just monitor for symptoms and see if anything changes.  Let us know if you have further questions or send in more photos.  Emily\nUser: Hello, Peyton face south, so they get full sun. They were planted last fall. I water with irrigation That’s about a foot off the ground and with the hose at ground level.  The irrigation runs very early in the morning.

Since the plant is in full sun and was planted last fall, it should be well-established by now. However, the combination of irrigation and hose watering might be keeping the soil too moist, especially if the soil doesn't drain well. Baptisia prefers well-drained soil and can be sensitive to overwatering. \\n\\nHere are some steps you can take to remedy the situation:\\n1. Check the soil moisture: Ensure the soil is not waterlogged. Allow the top few inches of soil to dry out between waterings.\\n2. Improve drainage: If the soil is heavy or clay-like, consider amending it with organic matter to improve drainage.\\n3. Monitor for pests or diseases: Inspect the plant for any signs of pests or fungal infections. If powdery mildew or another fungal issue is present, consider using a fungicide appropriate for Baptisia.\\n4. Adjust watering schedule: Since the plant is established, it may not need as much supplemental water. Consider reducing the frequency of irrigation.\\n\\nIf the problem persists, you might want to consult with a local extension service or a professional for a more detailed analysis. The attached images can also be helpful for a more precise diagnosis if you share them with a local expert. \\n\\nBest of luck with your Baptisia, and feel free to reach out if you have more questions!\"}"

This virus is known to cause such symptoms, particularly the upward rolling of leaves and discoloration. However, phosphorus deficiency can also cause purple veins, but it typically does not cause the rolling of new growth. Since you have ruled out herbicide drift and the symptoms are not present in your beets and potatoes, it is less likely to be a soil nutrient issue affecting only tomatoes. I recommend confirming the diagnosis by checking for other signs of beet curly top virus, such as stunted growth and yellowing of leaves. If the virus is confirmed, managing the leafhopper population, which spreads the virus, and removing infected plants can help control the spread.

These pests can cause significant damage by feeding on plant sap, leading to browning and bud loss. The fact that not all plants are affected could indeed be due to individual plant vulnerability or varying microclimates in your garden.\\n\\nThe recent heavy rains may have helped reduce the infestation by washing away some of the scales, which is why you might have noticed a decrease in their numbers. As for neem oil, it is a natural pesticide that can be effective against scale insects. It works by disrupting their growth and reproduction. If you choose to use neem oil, apply it in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid leaf burn and ensure thorough coverage of the affected areas.\\n\\nAdditionally, consider introducing beneficial insects like ladybugs or lacewings, which are natural predators of scale insects. Regular monitoring and maintaining plant health through proper watering and fertilization can also help prevent future infestations.

Since your azaleas are now in more sun, providing some shade can help reduce stress on the plants, making them less susceptible to infestations. You can also apply insecticidal soap or neem oil, which are less harmful to pets and the environment, ensuring to follow the instructions carefully.

The bee balm plants are 5+ years old, and were growing among black-eyed Susans, orange day lilies and wild ferns; all of the black-eyed Susans have died off, but I was told they were a variety with about a 3 year life span. The garden bed faces the north. I have already pulled out around 20 plants.  Is this treatable?\nExpert: Are the plants with these stem growths growing ok or are they declining? Growth like this can be caused by a few factors, some of them being normal. This looks to me like the start of adventitious root growth, which can sometimes happen in very wet conditions. If that's the case, the plants would likely look healthy. There are also some diseases that can cause symptoms similar to this, and maybe insects. Feel free to submit a sample to our plant diagnostic lab. Instructions can be found here: http://www.udel.edu/extension/plantclinic\nUser: Well, the plants I pulled out basically looked healthy.  LOL  The garden bed in on the north side of my house, and last year it was VERY dry and I only sporadically watered.  We have had a very wet spring and that's when I noticed these.  Also, all the black-eyed Susans had holes in the roots when I pulled them out. A gardener friend thought it looked like \"root-knot nematodes.\"  I did just order some Nematode Control to put in that bed.\nExpert: I would hold off on the nematode control for now--nematodes are a very important part of a healthy soil ecosystem! Only about 5% of nematode species in the soil are plant pathogenic, the vast majority are beneficial and are breaking down organic matter. Black eyed Susans are not susceptible to root-knot nematodes, maybe the holes were caused by insects or something else. After doing some research, I found that bee balm can form adventitious roots in response to windy conditions as well--using them for stability.\nUser: well, last summer a BUNCH of bee balm and Susans got wiped out with the wind storm we had--which also decimated 14 of our forty year old pine trees.  :(  so maybe they formed from that.....  UGH, the Nematode Control arrives tomorrow, wonder if I can return it.  Thanks again."

Also the bottom of the stem of one plant looks black. I had been watering by hand at soil level, but yesterday we used an overhead sprinkler as we have quite a large garden and everything needed water. Is this blight? What are your recommendations? Thanks for your help!\nExpert: Fortunately, this does not look like Late Blight. (We're assuming this is the \"blight\" you were referring to, since several plant diseases have \"blight\" in the name.) The blackened stem might be simply abiotic stress (due to environmental conditions and not a pest or disease). If it were a disease, then Southern Blight is a possibility, but the symptoms pictured don't strongly suggest that diagnosis. To make sure, and to discourage Southern Blight going forward, you can move the mulch away from the stem a few inches so it gets better air circulation. The characteristic mycelium (fungal threads) and spore capsules described and pictured in the page linked above can be diagnostic if found, but if not present, that infection is probably not occurring.  Leaf edge darkening might be due to drought stress or under-watering (even if only temporary, since leaf damage cannot reverse itself), natural leaf senescence (preparation for shedding), or perhaps leafhopper feeding. If you brush a hand through the foliage, see if any pale green wedge-shaped insects jump or fly off, which would suggest leafhoppers are around. At this point in potato season, no management of leafhoppers should be needed if the symptoms are not severe (they do not appear to be).  Miri\nUser: Thank you!

I have not mowed the lawn for several months, the sprinklers are turned off and I plan to keep them turned off.\nMust a lawn be mowed? What are the positives and negatives to allowing grass to grow.\nThank you.\nExpert: Hello, Emerson,  Grass gets its energy from the sun through its leaves. It converts light, caron dioxide, and water to create sugar (its food). The more leaf area, the more food it can create, assuming it has nitrogen and other nutrients available in the soil.   When you mow grass, you remove some of the leaf area. Some grasses (the ones used for lawns) have evolved to respond to this mowing (originally by animals) by producing more stems and more leaves at a shorter height. In essence, the grass gets denser. Consistent mowing is what creates the density and quality in a lawn (along with supplying it with nutrients via fertilizing).   If you stop mowing your grass, it will grow tall and thin out. There is no need for the grass to keep a lot of leaves down lower in the canopy where they will be shaded from the sun. This process will leave voids in the soil where other plants will germinate. Over time, more weeds will encroach including other grasses and broadleaf weeds.  As an aside, all plants need water. Depending on which grass species you have, you will have more or less plant death if you do not irrigate at all in Oregon summers. Perennial ryegrass will clump out meaning about half the plants will die. Tall fescue and fine fescue will mostly survive but will turn brown and go dormant. Over time, Rat-tail fescue and false dandelion will gradually come to dominate the area.  I would caution you a bit that just because you are planting \"native\" plants means they can survive the summer without irrigation. When I see displays of Oregon native plants, most of what gets shown are plants that naturally grow under the forest canopy that are in the shade all day.  I do not think the strategy of letting your existing lawn grow tall is a good one. If you want to convert your lawn to some other type of planting, that's great, but you should consider removing the sod either by sod cutting or spraying glyphosate to kill it (or using cardboard to cover it), perhaps rototilling, and then planting into the soil.  On the flip side, it probably doesn't hurt anything to try this strategy.  Maybe I am missing something, but I just do not see how it can be successful.  I hope this helps.\nUser: Thank you for the detailed response to my query. The ultimate goal for our property is to remove our sod (by cutting or using cardboard to cover it), plant an edible garden, and introduce \"native\" plants.Although it's very pretty, I am taking your advice and plan to have the property mowed. Do you suggest removing the cut grass or leaving in where it falls?

It may be lack of water since we are now in a dry spell. Young trees need about 5 gallons of water per week for the first 2-3 years.  Have you fertilized around it? They don't need any fertilizer so if they are growing in a lawn that gets fertilized they could be burnt from too much nitrogen. It also looks like it could be mites, from the photo you sent. You could send a sample to the diagnostic lab for identification, Instructions are in the link below. I would call them to make Sure you  collect the sample correctly. https://pdc.umn.edu/ https://trees.umn.edu/autumn-blaze%C2%AE-freemans-maple-acer-x-freemanii-%E2%80%98jeffersred%E2%80%99\nUser: This is one of 5 showing like this.  I am suspecting a drift of herbicide from treatment of soybeans across the road.  I was in the veg garden when they sprayed.  I could smell it, and within a week the tree looked this way.  It killed a large Marigold in the garden, in line to the maple location.Does this look like it could be the herbicide ?Also, will it grow out of it next year ?Thanks, Taylor, Sep 25, 2024, 9:06 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

Herbicide damage can cause leaf distortion, discoloration, and even defoliation. Whether the tree will recover depends on the extent of the damage. Trees can sometimes grow out of mild herbicide damage, and new growth next year may not show the same symptoms if the exposure was a one-time event. However, if the tree was severely affected, it might struggle to recover. To help the tree, ensure it is well-watered, especially during dry spells, and avoid any additional stressors like fertilization or pruning until it shows signs of recovery. Monitoring the tree next spring will be crucial to assess its recovery. If the problem persists or worsens, consulting with a local arborist or extension service might be beneficial.\"}"

One candidate for the creator of the webs is Fall Webworm (named for their more prominent second-generation webs that appear closer to fall) but there are other possibilities. If this is Fall Webworm, you can just tear open the webbing so birds and other predators can more easily access the caterpillars to eat them and insecticide use should not be needed. You can definitely always seek the assessment of a certified arborist given their training in proper tree care, but in this particular case that's probably not necessary.

It's best used in well-draining soils and should be mixed thoroughly with existing soil to dilute the salt concentration.\\n\\n2. **pH Level**: It tends to be slightly alkaline, so it may not be suitable for acid-loving plants like blueberries, azaleas, or rhododendrons.\\n\\n3. **Best Uses**: It is excellent for use in vegetable gardens, flower beds, and as a soil amendment for lawns. It can improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient content.\\n\\n4. **Worst Uses**: Avoid using it with plants that prefer acidic conditions or are sensitive to high salt levels. Also, be cautious when using it in containers, as the salt content can build up more quickly.\\n\\nOverall, mushroom compost can be a valuable addition to your garden if used appropriately and with consideration of the specific needs of your plants.\"}"

To address this issue, consider using motion-activated lights or sprinklers to deter nocturnal animals. Installing netting over the entire orchard can also be effective, though it requires more effort and investment. Another option is to use wildlife deterrents such as ultrasonic devices or scent repellents. Monitoring the area with a wildlife camera can help identify the specific culprits, allowing for more targeted measures.\"}"

We've encouraged it and it was producing many flowers in July-August. When one of the agencies sprayed herbicide at base of telephone poles they also sprayed plants on our property, killing all but one flower. I'd like to buy more to replace them but can't find out what it is. Any help is greatly appreciated. The flower shown is not very tall, unlike what was growing.\nExpert: Hi! I want to confer w/ another master gardener But it looks like a dahlia…. A rogue specimen!!! Is it in a protected spot? This area is usually too cold for them to make it through the winter. I’ll get back to you. I suggest weeding out some of the competing plants.\nExpert: Hi again, My cohorts agree it’s a dahlia. It was a warm winter and sometimes a tuber can survive.Count yourself lucky! It’s beautiful. Mulch in the fall and leave a stake to remember where it is and maybe it will return again next year! Good luck!\nUser: Thank you for your assistance. I'm surprised because, if this is the same plant that's been here for years, it has survived for over 25 years in our winters. Now I'm wondering if this is the same flower that has bloomed every year or my husband's picture is of a different flower and the original was killed. The flower was always at least 4 foot tall, sometimes more. It's not close to our house so it has always been noticeable from a distance. We definitely will stake the area and hope it comes back next year. It was irresponsible of the workers to spray our yard with defolient. The ironic part is that the weeds are growing just fine at the base of the pole they sprayed. Oh, well. I feel fortunate to have a source that can identify plants. Wish we'd taken photos when the original plant existed.  Thank you again.

Good luck,\nUser: I've grown Dahlias but have had to dig them up to save for next year. Never had one that grew tall but I've read that they do. It was luck that it was planted in a protected area where it came back year after year.  We bought an abandoned property that was in terrible condition. I ignored my rule of \"don't do anything until you've lived there a year to see what already was there\". I've since learned that the woman who lived here for many years was an avid gardener and there were still many of her plants. Unfortunately I destroyed what was a double pink poppy that never came back. Front lawn was a blanket of orange poppies.  I know that I have varieties of heirloom plants because women who know more have pointed them out to me. We had a beautiful perennnial garden along the side of the house (built in 1941). I've been severly disabled with a spinal cord injury for years and can't maintain the plants. I had a brown iris. But it's gone now, was dug up when we repaired our septic system. There's a heirloom yellow iris that is a true yellow.  Sorry for another letter from me. I'm happy to have our mystery plant identified. Wish I could still garden. Thank you again!

Pruning can indeed help with the flopping issue. For Hydrangeas, especially if they are the type that blooms on new wood, pruning by about one-third can help encourage stronger growth and a more compact shape. This should help reduce the flopping. Make sure to prune in late winter or early spring before new growth starts. Additionally, consider supporting the plant with stakes or a plant support ring if the flopping persists. This can provide extra support as the plant grows stronger.\"}"

        "value": "User: Hello,\n\nI am looking for help in removing and preventing the spread of a number of invasive plants.  In the last couple of years it seems like they are taking over everything.  In my food plot, for deer, knapweed now covers about 1/3 of it and it has taken root in my hayfield.  Other invasive plants that I have come across in my food plot and in our wild flower beds are. White campion, garlic mustard, Philadelphia fleabane, common wintercress, and stinging nettle.  Any recommendations please let me know.\n\nThank you for your time.\nExpert: Your options are going to depend on your food crop plants. Grasses will have options for chemical control of these plants, broadleaf species (e.g. soybeans, clover, etc.) will not. If you could rotate to an exclusively grass planting for a year or more you could use some of the synthetic auxins (e.g. triclopyr, 2,4-D, dicamba) to get these species under control and then rotate back to a mixed planting.  In the flower beds, physical removal is always an option, though challenging for some perennials. Spot spraying with a broadspectrum product (e.g. glyphosate) or dabbing it on would also be options. Unfortunately there are no preemergence approaches if you want native plant seeds to be able to emerge. Of the species listed, spotted knapweed and garlic mustard are the ones classified as invasive by the State of Michigan. As such, there may be some programs to aid in the management of these species. You can check with your local CISMA (see below) to see if they have any programs or local advise for these species. You can also check with your local conservation district, Genesse Conservation District (https://www.geneseecd.org/).   Cooperative Invasive Species Management Areas (CISMAS).  In Michigan there are several groups working to eradicate invasive plant species. Each group covers a cluster of counties and is funded by varying sources, some volunteer efforts, and sometimes property owners themselves. Groups have varying priority species and their abilities to help vary. If they are not able to help with a particular species of interest they still may be able to point you toward local, reputable companies that can help. You can find your CISMA at this site: https://www.michigan.gov/invasives/take-action/local-resources Usually there is a coordinators email and phone number listed and sometimes there is also a web address (or you can do an internet search for the group’s name).   Please let me know if you have any questions.\nUser: Hello, Riley, Thank you for getting back to me.  It is very concerning to me the number of plants that I'm finding on our little 10 acre parcel.  The last couple of years we have been cutting vines growing up a number of the trees.  These vines were overtaking the canopies.  Some of the vines were almost 2 inches in diameter.  I have not identified these vines yet, but am going to assume they are an invasive species as well. Two more plants that I've come across are the pokeweed and the black swallow-wort.  It's unbelievable how quickly they can take over an area.  Are either of these 2 plants considered invasive by the State of Michigan? My food plot is approximately 1/4 of an acre in size and the knapweed covers about 60% of it.  Clover is what I'm trying to grow in the plot.  We then have a narrow field that is close to 2 acres in size.  We have a friend who cuts and bales it for his cattle.  The knapweed has started to take over this field now. Because of the level of knapweed in the field, the farmer will not cut and bale it.  Says the cows just spit it out when they come in contact with it.Thank you for the additional information. ScottOn Thu, Jun 1, 2023 at 4:34 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: Scott,   Pokeweed is a native species, so not invasive and if in an area that is not frequented it is providing ecosystem services.  Black swallow-wort is classified as an invasive species. Here is where you can check out the lists: https://www.michigan.gov/invasives/id-report/plants  If you can send/attach photos of the foliage on the vines you haven't identified I might be able to help with that.   I think in these fields renovation might be the only way to get the knapweed under control. Kill everything off, make sure you effectively controlled the knapweed and then replant. There may still be some that emerge from the seedbank, so you would need to be scouting and spot spraying after that as necessary. If this is a route you decide to consider you would not want to use a synthetic auxin as previously described because it will prohibit you from successfully reseeding the clover do to carryover. In this situation glyphosate would likely be the best option. You could consider doing this to half you field at a time, but you don't want to let the half not being treated go to seed or it could disperse into the half you're trying to clean up.  Is the narrow two acre field also clover?\nUser: Hi, Riley, So pokeweed is not invasive?  It spreads and can take over an area very quickly.  My wife has been working on a couple of wildflower areas, nothing big, and that pokeweed pretty much took over one of them.  They were close to 5 feet tall.As for the narrow 2 acre parcel, we've been just letting it grow and then a farmer comes in and cuts and bales it. Starting 2 years ago he would not cut 1/2 to 3/4 of an acre because there was a little too much knapweed in it and his cows would just spit it out.  The farmer said he wasn't going to be able to cut and bale it for at least a month.  With the knapweed already flowering, a neighbor brush hogged it last night.  Hopefully we got it cut before any went to seed.I have included a few pictures of some of the plants growing in the woods and open areas.  The 3 pictures that start with the label vine are of the vine that likes to grow in trees, eventually taking over the canopy.  One is of a new vine starting and the other two of much older vines.  The 2 pictures are of a vine type plant that has overtaken a small hill we use for sledding.  This can take over an area rather quickly also.  I'm not sure what this plant is called and is it invasive.  I have also attached a picture of what I believe is called Reed Grass.  I'm not sure if this is invasive and if so, how one controls it.  The last picture shows what the knapweed looked like in the 2 acre field just before cutting it.As of now, I'm hoping to hit the clover food p]lot area with glyphosate by the end of the weekend.  Targeting to have the clover area replanted by late August/early September.Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions and helping me out.ScottOn Wed, Jun 7, 2023 at 10:53 AM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: Scott,  With regard to pokeweed, it is not classified as invasive...but even native plants can be aggressive and problematic for human activity. Invasive species are introduced species classified by some governing body (e.g. State of Michigan). They are given this designation when they are causing harm to the native species or the environment in some way or they are a threat to human health or the economy.   I'm glad to hear the knapweed was brush hogged. You definitely will reduce seed production this way. I have seed knapweed flowering below mowing height though, so it won't likely take care of all of it, particularly if it is behaving as a short lived perennial.   I think two of the three vine photos you sent look like poison ivy. I think the dangling vine photo looks like a wild grape species. They usually have shaggy bark like that. I shared these with my colleague here, Angie Tenney, and she agrees. Both poison ivy and the grape species found in Michigan are also native.  I think your plan to renovate the clover field with glyphosate will be a good start. Since it has been dry and the plants are flowering, they maybe under stress and you may not get a good of control as if you wait until you see new green growth to treat. New growth indicates that the processes in the plant are fully functioning and a systemic herbicide like glyphosate will move throughout the plant better.\nUser: Hi, Riley, In checking out the link from your prior email listing the plants considered invasive, I see I can add the Autumn Olive to the list of invasive species on the property.  Apparently Autumn Olive is very difficult to kill.  I must admit though that their berries taste pretty good and the deer like them too.  The wild grape seem to just take over a tree and kill it. We've cut vines that were close to 3 inches in diameter.  I noticed over the weekend that some knapweed has started to grow in our yard and the neighbor's yard.  Hopefully we can stop it from spreading further.  How long can knapweed live without flowering?Interesting point about when to apply the glyphosate.  I was thinking now would be the time when they are under duress.  We'll need a little more rain than what we received on Sunday before applying the glyphosate.Thank you for your time and answering my questions.ScottOn Fri, Jun 9, 2023 at 2:38 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

Here are some strategies:\\n\\n1. **Manual Removal**: Regularly dig up the plants, ensuring you remove as much of the root system as possible. This may need to be repeated several times as Ground Elder can regrow from small root fragments.\\n\\n2. **Smothering**: Cover the affected area with a thick layer of mulch, cardboard, or black plastic to block sunlight. This can weaken the plants over time.\\n\\n3. **Herbicides**: Use a systemic herbicide that targets broadleaf plants. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully and consider the impact on surrounding plants and the environment.\\n\\n4. **Regular Mowing**: If the Ground Elder is in a lawn area, regular mowing can help weaken it over time.\\n\\n5. **Plant Competition**: Introduce competitive plants that can outcompete Ground Elder for resources.\\n\\nPersistence is key, as it may take multiple seasons to fully eradicate Ground Elder. Combining several methods often yields the best results.\"}"

Tall fescue is a cool-season grass, which means it grows most actively in the cooler months of spring and fall. Applying a high nitrogen fertilizer in late spring is generally not recommended, as it can lead to excessive growth that stresses the grass during the hotter summer months. Since your lawn looks fine now and you fertilized in late fall, it should have enough nutrients to carry it through the summer. Instead, focus on proper watering and mowing practices to maintain its health. If you notice any specific issues, such as thinning or discoloration, you might consider a targeted treatment, but a general high nitrogen application is not necessary at this time.\"}"

One possibility is market conditions; if the demand for hops has decreased or if prices have dropped, farmers might choose not to invest in the labor and materials required to string the hops. Another reason could be crop rotation or soil health management practices, where farmers decide to let the plants grow without training them to climb to give the soil a rest or to prepare for a different crop cycle. Additionally, labor shortages or changes in farming strategies could also influence this decision. If you're considering growing hops in your garden, it's worth noting that hops are perennial plants and require a structure to climb for optimal growth and yield.\"}"

If so, any publications to share with homeowners on what is causing this to be so high in 2024.\nExpert: As a Master Gardener volunteer I have not received any information that grub populations are high in 2024.  My thought is that there might be more Japanese beetle grubs due to the wetter than normal summer we had (because they like irrigated turf).  But that would be somewhat offset by a probable decrease in the European Chafer grub population as they prefer drier turf settings. Considering that October has been warmer than normal,  grub activity could extend later into the fall before temperatures cool enough for them to go into hibernation until spring. I have asked my local Consumer Horticultural Educator if he has heard/read anything.  No reply yet.  If he has a positive answer I'll pass it on to you in another email. I'm assuming if you are asking the question you think/know you have a grub problem.  Having a healthy turf is the first line of defense against grubs.  I recommend doing a soil test if you haven't done one in two years. You will learn more about your soil including soil type, pH, nutrient levels and more. Knowing the type and fertility of your soil is the starting point to establishing & maintaining a strong turf that can resist diseases, moss, weeds, insects/grubs and look great at an optimal cost.

Zucchini plants have separate male and female flowers, and pollinators like bees are needed to transfer pollen from male to female flowers. You can try hand-pollinating by using a small brush to transfer pollen from the male to the female flowers. Additionally, ensure that the plant is receiving adequate water and nutrients. \\n\\nRegarding your hydrangea, since it is a mophead variety, it blooms on old wood. If you prune it too late in the season, you might be cutting off the buds that would bloom the following year. Make sure to prune right after it blooms, or not at all if it hasn't bloomed. Also, consider the possibility of winter damage to the buds, which can prevent blooming. You might want to provide some winter protection to the plant. Lastly, ensure that the soil pH is suitable for hydrangeas, as they prefer slightly acidic to neutral soil.\"}"

Elemental sulfur is often recommended for lowering soil pH, but it can take several months to fully react in the soil. Make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for application rates. Additionally, incorporating organic matter like peat moss can help acidify the soil over time. Regularly monitor the soil pH to track changes. As for the fertilizer, ensure it is suitable for acid-loving plants like blueberries, as some fertilizers can inadvertently raise the pH.

One effective method is manual removal, which involves pulling out the plants by hand, ensuring you remove as much of the root system as possible to prevent regrowth. This is best done when the soil is moist. Another option is to use a non-selective herbicide, such as glyphosate, which can be applied directly to the leaves of the sedum. Be cautious with herbicides, as they can affect other plants in the area. It's important to follow the instructions on the label for safe and effective use. Additionally, maintaining a healthy lawn through regular mowing, fertilization, and overseeding can help prevent the sedum from re-establishing. If the infestation is severe, you might consider consulting with a local extension service or a professional landscaper for more targeted advice.\"}"

We have been planting and adding to their garden for a few years now and have noticed plants declining and dying without explanation. I have done a soil analysis through the extension and all conditions seem to be excellent for planting. However, we discovered that most areas of the garden are riddled with hundreds of worms, which very much look like invasive Asian Jumping worms. The first 2 inches of soil are nothing but worm castings. I have attached a picture here for ID. Thanks for any help.\nExpert: Hi, Dakota, I agree that it's an Asian Jumping Worm (based on the location and color of the clitellum). Unfortunately, there are currently no viable jumping earthworm control methods (but research is ongoing). Management hinges upon stopping their spread, and there are some methods that can be somewhat effective. Now that your area is known to be infested, avoid moving soil/plants from there to other areas. Tools/boots/tires used in that area should have all the soil removed from them before being used in new areas. Hand-pickingCollecting and killing the worms on sight is an option, albeit labor-intensive. Worms that are caught can be left in the sun for several hours to kill them. Once dead, the worms can be disposed of without fear of spreading them to new areas.  To make hand-picking easier, use a mustard pour (which is totally harmless to plants). Mix a gallon of water with 1/3 cup of ground yellow mustard seed and pour slowly into the soil. This will drive any worms to the surface where you can easily remove them.Soil SolarizationUsing a clear plastic tarp, completely envelop soil and leave it in the sun so the mass reaches at least 104°F for at least three days Let me know if you have further questions.\nUser: Thank you for the ID and the information regarding management. I haven't heard of these being an issue in Colorado yet- I am a little concerned since the worms have seemingly infested the entire property. We are worried that this will spread to neighboring properties and eventually will become a larger issue than one backyard. If there is anything that we need to do to avoid larger environmental impacts, please let me know. Thank you. On Wed, Sep 11, 2024 at 1:39 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

This could include deep trenches or barriers made of materials that worms cannot easily cross.\\n\\n3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regularly monitor the property and surrounding areas for signs of worm activity. Early detection in neighboring areas can help manage the spread more effectively.\\n\\n4. **Community Involvement**: Engage with local gardening clubs or community groups to raise awareness and develop a community-wide strategy for managing and preventing the spread of these worms.\\n\\n5. **Report Findings**: Keep in touch with local extension services or environmental agencies to report your findings and any new developments.

The first pruning should be done in late winter or early spring before the plant starts to leaf out, similar to your practice in Wisconsin. This helps to control the size and shape of the plant. The second pruning can be done in the summer, around July or August, to trim back the long shoots that have grown during the spring and early summer. This helps to maintain the plant's shape and encourages flowering. Make sure to cut back the shoots to about three to six buds from the main stem. This dual pruning approach will help keep the Wisteria manageable and promote healthy growth and flowering.\"}"

Check out this photo: https://fieldguide.bcblueberry.com/virus-not-in-bc/ If it is leaf mottle it is pollen transmitted, I would recommend sending it somewhere for testing. You have two options but Michigan State University might be the less expensive approach. At the moment we just offer ELISA testing. The other option is Agdia.

If I leave the bushes , what will happen? Will they just eventually die? Will the bushes  potentially produce anymore fruit ? (As mentioned earlier I pruned them all the way back last year for Putnam scale so I didn’t anticipate any yield this year anyway )2. If I would rip them out, is there any risk of harm to future non-blueberry plants (ie if I would plant a vegetable garden, or other fruits perhaps such as raspberries) , or is this virus specific to blueberries?Thanks much for your help. Rachel On Thu, Aug 22, 2024 at 10:20 AM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

Since the bush has been in the same location for many years, it's unlikely that the location itself is the issue.

Peonies typically need full sun to bloom well, which means at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day.\\n\\n2. **Soil Conditions**: Check the soil pH and nutrient levels. Peonies prefer slightly acidic to neutral soil (pH 6.0-7.0). If the soil is too alkaline or lacking in nutrients, it might affect blooming.\\n\\n3. **Fertilization**: While you mentioned trying fertilizer, ensure that it's balanced and not too high in nitrogen, as excessive nitrogen can promote foliage growth at the expense of blooms.\\n\\n4. **Pruning Practices**: Avoid cutting back the foliage too early in the season. The leaves are essential for photosynthesis and storing energy for the next year's blooms.\\n\\n5. **Pests or Diseases**: Although the bush looks healthy, inspect it for any signs of pests or diseases that might be affecting bud formation.\\n\\nBy addressing these factors, you may be able to encourage your peony bush to bloom again.

Thanks, Charlie\nExpert: Hello, Charlie, Thank you for reaching out to the UVM Extension Master Gardener Helpline with your question about your tomato plant leaf. From your picture, the prognosis would most likely be Early Blight. Early Blight usually happens when fungal spores over wintering in the ground are splashed onto the bottom leaves of the tomato plant or brought there by an insect. I am attaching 2 really good resources with strategies to help remediate this problem. At the very least, you should make sure the plants are well weeded to allow for good air flow, place hay underneath to help stop the splash ups, pull off those lower leaves and dispose of them properly, if you water, make sure you don't water the leaves, and stake them up on a sunny day when the leaves are dry.  I am embedding two links with some information that you might find useful. The first link is from the UVM website. It explains some good gardening practices that will help keep tomato plants healthy.  It also has some photos so you will be able to visually compare Early Blight to Late Blight.  https://www.uvm.edu/sites/default/files/Extension-Community-Horticulture/Tomato_Problems_2016_2.pdf The second link is from the Missouri Botanical Garden and has a list of 6 specific integrated pest management strategies. https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/help-for-the-home-gardener/advice-tips-resources/insects-pests-and-problems/diseases/fungal-spots/early-blight-of-tomato I wish you the best of luck with your tomato plants and thank you for your question.\nUser: Thank you very much Lisa!   Larry   From: ask=<personal data hidden> <ask=<personal data hidden>> On Behalf Of Ask Extension Sent: Friday, July 26, 2024 9:37 PM To: Larry Mindell <<personal data hidden>> Subject: Re: Is this tomato blight?

Here are some guidelines:\\n\\n1. **Light**: Keep your Christmas cacti in a location where they receive bright, indirect sunlight. Direct sunlight can be too harsh and may cause the leaves to burn.\\n\\n2. **Water**: Water your Christmas cacti when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. Be careful not to overwater, as this can lead to root rot.\\n\\n3. **Feeding**: Fertilize your Christmas cacti every month during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer. Reduce feeding in the fall and winter.\\n\\n4. **Dormancy**: To encourage blooming, you should provide a period of darkness for about 12-14 hours each night starting in mid-October. This can be achieved by placing the plant in a dark room or covering it with a box.\\n\\n5. **Trimming**: You can trim your Christmas cacti after it has finished blooming, usually in late winter or early spring. Trim back any leggy growth to maintain a compact shape. Use clean, sharp scissors or pruning shears to make clean cuts.\\n\\nBy following these care tips, your Christmas cacti should thrive and bloom beautifully around Christmas.\"}"

So eradication is a process over time. \n \nThe infestation is dense, in an area about 100' x 100'. I just employed several approaches on our patch of PP as experiments. All were manual (no chemicals) and were done while plants were flowering, but before they set seeds:\n \n• I dug and pulled roots and plant with Parsnip Predator shovel, then took roots/plants to our landfill. Some say this is the best method but digging and pulling by the roots is really time consuming and lugging big bags to landfill is all hard work.\n \n• On another section, I used Parsnip Predator shovel to sever the stalks by slicing through the top of the roots. Root stays in the ground. I’ve left the severed stalks and tops on the ground. I’ve read “this kills the plant.” But does it kill the root? I plan to mow the field in the fall, or earlier if new stalks emerge. This is all pretty efficient, still time consuming.\n \n• In another spot, I snipped off seed structure at top of plant and left the rest of the plant as-is. This removes seeds before maturity but new ones will surely appear this season. At that point, I can snip off new seed structures, or mow, or both. This is easiest but likely least effective.\n \nDo you have insight on these methods plus suggestions and recommendations?"

Here are some insights and recommendations for each method you've tried:\\n\\n1. **Digging and Pulling Roots**: This method is effective as it removes the entire plant, preventing regrowth. However, as you noted, it is labor-intensive. To make it more manageable, consider breaking the area into smaller sections and tackling them over time.\\n\\n2. **Severing Stalks**: Severing the stalks can be effective if done consistently. While it may not kill the root immediately, repeated cutting can deplete the root's energy reserves, eventually leading to its death. Mowing in the fall can help manage any regrowth.\\n\\n3. **Snipping Seed Structures**: This method helps prevent seed dispersal, which is crucial for controlling the spread. However, it does not address the existing plants. Combining this with other methods, like mowing, can improve effectiveness.\\n\\n**Additional Recommendations**:\\n- **Smothering**: As you mentioned with buckthorn, smothering can be effective. Consider using black plastic or tarps to cover areas after cutting to prevent regrowth.\\n- **Regular Monitoring**: Keep an eye on the area for new growth and address it promptly to prevent the plants from reaching maturity.\\n- **Community Effort**: If possible, involve neighbors or local community groups to help manage the infestation, as this can distribute the workload and increase effectiveness.\\n\\nOverall, persistence and a combination of methods will be key to successfully eradicating Poison Parsnip from your area.\"}"

I apologize for all my questions.  I am endeavoring to provide you with a course of action that might be effective.  Since you have been dealing with bent grass for several seasons, previous courses of action do not appear to have been completely satisfactory.

This is when bentgrass is most vulnerable. Consider planning future applications around this time for better results.\\n\\n2. **Overseeding Strategy**: After the final Tenacity application, wait a couple of weeks before overseeding. This will allow the herbicide to take full effect. Use a high-quality seed mix suitable for your region and lawn conditions, focusing on species that establish quickly and can outcompete bentgrass.\\n\\n3. **Aeration and Soil Health**: Continue with aeration to improve soil health and promote the growth of desirable grass species. Healthy soil can help your lawn resist invasive species like bentgrass.\\n\\n4. **Consultation with Experts**: Since you've had difficulty finding a reliable lawn care service, consider reaching out to local university extension services or horticultural societies for expert advice. They may offer consultations or recommend professionals who specialize in turf management.\\n\\n5. **Regular Monitoring**: Keep a close eye on your lawn, especially in areas where bentgrass has been problematic.

(Please see the attached photo IMG_1790.)  Grass plants turning brown & dead only occurs in the lawn on that side of our house, and not on the other three sides.  It also doesn't seem to occur in the lawns of any of our neighbors.  The one thing present in our front lawn (and not present in the lawns on the other three sides of our house, nor in the lawns of our neighbors) is our Imperial Locust tree (the tree in the foreground of IMG_1790).  Is there something in the roots of the Imperial Locust, and/or in its leaves (which cover our front lawn in the fall until we rake them up) which kills grass plants?  The thick dark green grass adjacent to our Imperial Locust may seem to contradict that hypothesis.  But the healthy grass growing there may be misleading.  We planted that grass (from Scotts' grass seed) just a few years ago.  So whatever species of grass that was in that seed may be resistant to toxins from our Locust tree's roots or leaves.\n\nThirdly, since we had so much brown dead grass in our front yard this spring, the first fertilizer that I applied to our whole lawn this spring was not \"Scotts Turf Builder with HALTS Crabgrass Preventer\", but \"Scotts Turf Builder Green Max\".   The grass plants on the other three sides of our house (i.e. NOT the side with the Locust Tree) seemed to green up a little faster than normal.  However, we now have a problem with Black Medic(?) growing in the grass on all four sides of our home, which problem I've never seen in our lawn before.  (Please see the attached photo IMG_1915.)  (Maybe the \"Scotts Turf Builder with HALTS Crabgrass Preventer\" was preventing it from growing in prior years.)  My questions to you about this problem are:\na) Is that Black Medic?  If not, what is it?\nb) What herbicide (i..e. brand name) or herbicide ingredient (i.e. chemical compound) do you \n    recommend for killing that plant, but NOT killing the grass plants in our lawn?\n\nThank you for your answer to my first question (about what might be killing much of the grass in our front lawn every year) and for your best advice to my second set of questions (about the Black Medic[?] and how to kill it).\n\nGratefully yours,\nRoman\nExpert: I did not find any information that the Imperial Locust tree produces toxins from roots or leaves that are harmful to turf. I'd start by doing a soil test on your front lawn to learn more about your soil including soil type, pH, nutrient levels and more. Knowing the type and fertility of your soil is the starting point to establishing & maintaining a strong turf that can resist diseases, moss and insects/grubs and look great. More info here: Don't Guess-Soil Test-MSU and MSU Home Soil Test-self mailer You state that the lawn is dead when the snow melts in the spring.  This points to possible pink snow mold or grey snow mold as the problem.  No way to tell now as the evidence is gone. Here  are links to turf diseases and their prevention: MSU Turf disease ID  Purdue turf disease ID Turfgrass Disease Chart-OSU  I'd reseed the front yard (after getting a soil test) making sure to stop fertilizing after Oct 1.  The best time to reseed is Aug15-Sept 15 and earlier is better.  Raking the leaves up is a good idea too or mulch them into the turf.  More info on reseeding in the attached links: Establishing A New Lawn Using Seed (E2910)-MSU Renovating A Lawn for Quality & sustainability-UMN How to Overseed A Lawn-Iowa Lawn Renovation & Over-seeding-UMass Renovation of Lawns-PSU  Yes the weed isBlack Medic:  This weed can be suppressed or controlled with various postemergence herbicides, particularly those containing dicamba, MCPP, and/or fluroxypyr.  There are products at the local big box store.  I recommend spot spraying over a full lawn application.  Get it done quickly before the black medic goes to seed.  Next spring go back to the fertilizer with pre-emergent for additional control.

You also answered my first question, about whether Imperial Locust roots or leaves have toxins harmful to grass plants.  A while after your answer, however, I think that I may have figured out what is causing much of the grass in our front lawn to be dead by spring, and it's only indirectly related to Imperial Locust leaves.  I saw our problem (i.e. much of the grass in our front lawn being dead by spring) only in our front lawn (where we have that Imperial Locust tree), and in none of our other yards (which have no Imperial Locusts), and in none of our neighbors' yards (which also have no Imperial Locusts).  So, I assumed that this problem had something to do with that tree.  However, later this summer, I also noticed/remembered an area in our back yard which also had a lot of dead grass this past spring, and I realized what is common between that area, and our front lawn:  both of those areas were very strenuously raked the prior fall:- I strenuously raked our front yard last fall to try to pick up all of the Imperial Locust leaves' small leaflets;- I also strenuously raked that area in our back yard last fall to try to pick up the numerous leaves which had fallen & gathered there from our neighbor's back yard trees.So, maybe it's my strenuous raking which is killing the grass plants in those two areas.  I wanted to share this hypothesis with you in case anyone else ever contacts you with the same problem (areas of dead light-brown grass in the springtime, in a lawn where the other grass plants are just fine).Gratefully yours,Roman SkikunOn Sat, Jul 22, 2023 at 1:05 AM Roman Skikun <<personal data hidden>> wrote:Dear, Dakota:Thank you very much for the time & care that you took to provide me such detailed & helpful answers to my questions.  I greatly appreciate it.Gratefully yours,Roman SkikunNovi, MIOn Wed, Jul 19, 2023 at 8:45 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

On the other side of the fence is rock and then goes into neighbors lawn. This morning, I noticed some yellow leaves, this usually happens in the fall before the leaves fall off. I normally do not have to water the tree, in the past it seems to be growing just fine. This is the first year I ever had any issues. Again, any helpful suggestions would be appreciated. If you Need any further, information please let me know. Thank you, Morgan from my iPad On Jul 12, 2024, at 8:43 AM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:   ﻿\nExpert: Thank you. This could be caused by root damage or possibly by the honeylocust spider mite (or perhaps also the honeylocust right mite).  During heavy mite infestations, large portions of the crown may turn off-yellow and the leaves will drop prematurely.  Mites are usually problematic for trees in dry sites; if the tree is getting water from turfgrass they are less likely to be the culprit.  If you are able to look closely at the yellowing leaves you can check for the presence of the mites, which are light green/yellowish, and quite small.   Root damage may have been caused by under- or over-watering, though if this is the first year for damage and your watering practices have not changed, this seems unlikely as well. Another possible cause for root damage or leaf-drop like what you're seeing is damage from herbicides.  Do you know if any herbicides have been used in the rock areas on either side of the fence? John\nUser: I have not used a herbicide But I cannot say if my neighbor has on his side of the fence or not. Since we’ve had some hot and dry weather, Would it be a good idea to feed and deep water the tree around the drip line with a deep water needle attached to a water hose?

I recommend you hire a certified arborist if we can’t figure this out together. To try this, I need a closer photo of a branch showing the place where it goes from alive to dead, if possible. A couple of distant views also. You need to illustrate the whole thing so we can see any pattern to the dead spots. How far back does the fully dead area reach? Dead is brittle and no green if you scratch the bark. Are these limbs dead clear to the trunk? Do you see lesions on the trunk bark? Then also, tell me everything you can think of about it. When did this start and how fast is it changing? What fertilizer or herbicides have been used in the area, and when. Describe summer irrigation. Has any construction or ditching been done? I hope we can get this, but it does become sort of a game of 20 questions.\nUser: Photos are attached.\nUser: More photos\nUser: Last 2 photos.\nUser: Hello,Thank you for your response.

Common chickweed is a winter annual that germinates summer through fall. You can easily manage these by lightly tilling the soil and disrupting their root systems. You can read more about both of these plants here: https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/stellaria-media/ https://extension.umass.edu/weed-herbarium/weeds/anagallis-arvensis Consider using a mulch material in your garden to prevent further weed growth. https://www.canr.msu.edu/resources/smart_gardeners_improve_their_soil_and_weed_control_with_organic_mulch\nUser: Thank you for your input.  I do not think this is chickweed.  The pimpernel comes closer; the leaves look similar to what I'm dealing with, but the flowers on my mystery weed are white and much, much smaller.  Thus I'm not sure we are there yet with the ID of this weed.  Any further ideas you might have would always be welcome.

I agree, it's been a tricky one for me to put my finger on since many of the characteristics are just not a good fit for the most common weeds we see in a veggie garden. Are you able to give me some more site information? and possibly send some pictures of the entire seedling (including roots) placed on a contrasting background along with a ruler or coin for scale?  How long has it been growing at your site? Did you have any plants nearby that could have gone to seed in this area? What natural features are near your garden? lowland, upland habitat? How much sun does the area receive? Anything else that might be pertinent.\nUser: Thanks again for your reply.  My vegetable garden is 10 by 20 feet and is situated alongside the house, with a south and west exposure.  The adjacent house has a neglected, weedy area just to the south of my garden, but there has never been any sign of the weed in question growing in there.  I have been working this same garden for over 40 years, and for at least half that time I have routinely spaded grass clippings and maple leaves into the garden in the fall in an attempt to lighten and improve the soil.  For better or worse, I have tried to keep oak leaves out of the garden - even as we have many large oak trees in the yard - in the belief they would make the soil too acidic.  Despite these efforts, the soil remains quite heavy.  The offending weed has been present in the garden for about the last 10 years.  It routinely starts appearing in mid-to-late June.  The only recourse is to try to pull out the individual plants, but the roots are very tough, and the stems are apt to break before the whole plant can be removed.  This summer the infestation has been unusually bad, and ironically it comes at a time that the garden itself is doing very poorly.  My bean and swiss chard seeds have either failed to germinate or have come up and then withered.  For the one third or so that have actually progressed beyond that point, the plants are just not thriving as in the past.  Thus I am in the process of submitting a soil sample to MSU.  i would be happy to send you more photos, but it might be easier to text them to you..

We may have found our answer with False Pimpernel Lindernia dubia. We were close! https://michiganflora.net/record/1638 https://www.minnesotawildflowers.info/flower/false-pimpernel You might notice that it is adapted to bare mud or wet sand on shores, river banks, marsh and pond margins. I wonder if your veggie garden is close to a body of water as well. You said the soil is heavy, and I wonder if the water table is quite high there. If the soil stays moist for prolonged periods this could impact seed germination and cause dampening off of seedlings. We see this most often in a greenhouse setting, but I'm wondering if what you noticed this year could be related to soil moisture. https://extension.psu.edu/damping-off\nUser: Thank you for your continued work on this!  I am in the process of trying to send you more photos as you requested but have hit some technical obstacles at this end.  I will keep trying.  After looking up lindernia dubia on Google, the one small photo provided comes the closest yet to the weed in question, although there is no scale in the picture, and the flower looks a little big; the flowers I'm seeing here are very tiny.  As for your questions about my garden, the soil is rather heavy, which is why I have been trying to lighten it in recent years with dead maple leaves and grass clippings...and Canadian peat back in the 80s and 90s.  It is not near a stream or lake, and the portions where the weed is at its worst are not particularly wet.  Could this weed have come in with the peat?  I do not have it anywhere else in my yard, nor  have I ever seen it anyplace else, including Frederik Meijer Gardens, where I volunteer in the horticulture area,,,and where nobody there can say what this week is!

I don’t think that any possible fungus in your yard is associated with this formation on your hackberry. We have been getting a fair number of questions so far this season dealing lawn fungus. We believe that this may be due to heavy, recent rainfalls. The foliage on the tree is puzzling to me. By any chance do you still have the plant label that came attached to the tree? Lacking that, if you know where you purchased the tree, might you be able to contact them and see what kind of records they have regarding the lineage of the tree. Specifically ask if your hackberry is a hybrid plant.  Lastly, have you ever done any pruning of the tree? I am trying to decide if its current appearance came after some pruning events, or if it developed naturally. For how many years has it looked like this? Looking forward to your responses. Thanks for using our forum.\nUser: This was planted as a young tree by the builders in a new development 5 years ago and they told us it was a hackberry but that's all the information I have on it. No pruning of the tree. Last year it did have the raised warts on the backs of most leaves. I believe it started last year but very mild and I didn't think much of it. This year is worse than last. More noticeable. On Mon, Jun 17, 2024, 6:15 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: Thanks for your response. I suspect that the “warts” you observed both last year and this year are attributable to mites known as hackberry Psyllids (Pachypsylla celtidismamma). They will not harm your hackberry and they can simply be ignored. More specifically these “warts” are called leaf galls. They have mite larvae within them. The adults of these insects are extremely small and hard to detect. See the following for images of the galls and the adults: https://bugguide.net/node/view/229821 https://bugguide.net/node/view/229829 Here’s the deal.  In spring 2023, adults of these insects emerged from places where they had overwintered during 2022-23. This could have been under pieces of bark or some other nook or cranny of the hackberry. These adults mated and females laid eggs on the leaves of your tree. Larvae quickly hatched. These larvae burrowed into the leaf tissue. The leaves responded by enclosing the larvae with a form of a leaf cancerous growth that is a type of defensive response. This led to the appearance of the bumps and nodules (galls) that you saw in 2023. These larvae developed into adults in late summer 2023. The adults went into hibernation for the winter 2023-24. When they emerged early this 2024 season, the process started all over again. See: https://extension.illinois.edu/blogs/garden-scoop/2019-07-25-hackberry-gall https://lancaster.unl.edu/pest/resources/hackberrypsyllids.shtml Going back to the shape of the hackberry, how long have you been noticing this shape?

It was like a dead end, per say. Any suggestions as to this being a great application for wheat? What exactly is this product for, as the sulfur written part, has the potential for questioning? What would be the recommended amount per acre, when applied? Would it be a good cost effective product, compared to other like products, with safety to the environment included? I would so much appreciate any help concerning this subject!! Thank You again!!\nExpert: Hello, Alex,  Are you looking to fertilize a planted wheat field? that is a fertilizer you could use to get nitrogen and sulfur. below is a link to a great publication by MSU on the MI wheat website that does a great job explaining how to fertilize wheat. I goes by the yield potential. Do you know what the expected yield is on the field. I also would not recommend doing a nitrogen broadcast application because of how dry it is, would be a waste!  https://bigwclients.com/miwheat/michigan-wheat-101/\nUser: Hi!! Thank You for yoúr reply. The 101 will hopefully be helpful. My question is to find about this particular product, and it's  application. I find no information on it, in trying to find out about it. At first glance it appears as if it is a type of sulfur alone, which would be for like fungal, or insecticide application. I wanted to know what it is exactly, and what used for exactly. Who manufactures it? I certainly agree with you that for that (fungal/insecticide) circumstance and instance, with no rain, it would be a waste of time. Would it also be a waste of time if it is a fertilizer also, and applied dry, since there has been no rain? Is this product a mix of both fertilizer and fungal/insecticide? I really enjoy the details of an item. If I were to say look up Miracle Grow, I can find out lots of information. This product is like crickets; at least to look up online, for information. The amount that is said to be obtained per acre, for the wheat production, is 100 bushel per acre. Would this product be the key for that type of situation, or would another brand be better? On Tue, May 30, 2023, 10:52 AM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: Hello, Alex,  That is not a branded product like miracle grow, that is just a fertilizer. Any fertilizer company could make that blend for a farmer. The numbers just indicate the percentage of the nutrient in that blend. So 39-0-0-6 is 39% nitrogen and 6% sulfur. Sulfur, besides being a fertilizer, is also used sometime (especially in organic systems) as a boost to a plant immune system. So it can help with disease.   There is more detail on fertilizer and how to determine the type and rate in the bulletin I sent over. 100 bu/acre is a higher then normal wheat yield. I would shoot for more of an 60-80 bu/acre. We have also passed the fertilizing window for this year because of the stage the wheat is in.\nUser: Hello, Taylor, Thank You for giving me a lot of information, for my better understanding. Now I will give you the Paul Harvey, rest of the story. I felt that an advisor amount of what is written as 14,500.000 ( which looks to me as million, but  I have to assume is thousand); is an excessive amount, to put on a told to me, 51 acre field. It is stretched by others as being a 55 acre field. So, that amount of said fertilizer, which I thought because of the sulfur told part, might have been rather; being used as an insecticide, or fungal/mold application. I felt the advise might be foolhardy for that situation, as it has been so dry, where would be the need. But I needed to find out if what I was thinking had any bearing, for my stance. The application was placed on \"4-15-2023\". All of April showed 0\" inches of rainfall for our area. All of May showed .69\" inches of rainfall for the total month, for our area. The total of over 7 ton of \"39-00-00 6% sulfur \", was  placed, on a pushing it 55 acre field. I did not feel that was necessary in the least. However I wanted to see if an Expert wouldn't set me straight, if I was in error; or back me, if I was correct. I felt the advisor was in error, in advising such proportions, even in the supposed gusto, of trying to get a  pushed for, 100 bu per acre. No one else would bother to answer my questions, concerning the advisor's choice. So I opted to Ask the Expert, rather. Where do I stand? Thank You So Much for Your time with me!!

Without sufficient rainfall, much of the fertilizer may not be utilized effectively, leading to potential waste and environmental concerns. Additionally, aiming for a 100 bushel per acre yield is quite ambitious and may not be realistic under such dry conditions. It might have been more prudent to adjust the fertilizer application rate to match more typical yield expectations, such as 60-80 bushels per acre, and to consider the current weather conditions. Your concerns about the advisor's recommendation seem valid, and it would be wise to consult with a local agronomist or extension service for tailored advice in the future.\"}"

This includes ensuring good air circulation around the plants, avoiding overhead watering, and applying preventive fungicides during the growing season.\\n\\n3. **Removal**: Given your concern about chemical exposure and the extent of the infestation, removal might be the best option if you prefer not to engage in regular chemical treatments. You can replace them with more resistant plant varieties or those that require less maintenance.\\n\\nUltimately, the decision depends on your willingness to manage the ongoing care and your personal preference for maintaining these plants. If you choose to remove them, consider consulting with a local nursery for alternative plant recommendations that suit your landscape and maintenance preferences.\"}"

Copper fungicides are most effective when applied preventatively. You should start spraying in early spring, just before the buds break, and continue at regular intervals as recommended on the fungicide label, especially during wet weather conditions which favor the spread of the rust. Since you are aiming to minimize pesticide use, ensure you follow the label instructions carefully to avoid over-application. Additionally, consider cultural practices such as removing any nearby junipers or cedars if feasible, as they are alternate hosts for the rust.

Here is a bulletin to compare with what you see. https://extension.umd.edu/resource/white-prunicola-scale/  Each scale insect must be treated at the correct time in its lifecycle. So, we need to identify this scale insect.  Please try to get some clear close up pictures of a branch with the scale. Use good light, from about 7-9 inches away. We can magnify a clear image, but magnifying a blurry one will not help.  Other ways to get a positive ID: Submit a branch sample to the MSU Plant Diagnostic lan.

Since you mentioned the substance is dry and not sticky, this aligns with the characteristics of woolly aphids. To manage them, you can regularly spray the affected areas with water to dislodge the aphids. Additionally, you might consider using insecticidal soap or neem oil if the infestation persists. It's important to monitor the tree for any further signs of stress or infestation. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out. Best regards, Laura.\"}"

        "value": "User: I am trying to find more specific information on sagebrush voles but through extension resources mostly find info on meadow (?) voles more common in western Oregon. I have for the first time seen tunneling in my front flower beds only but no obvious exit holes described near them and no obvious signs in the lawn (about half is miniclover). The tunnels are ridged that fit a mole description but no mounded dirt in lawns or the beds. There is no girdling of two maple trees that are in the front that I can see. A decorative cabbage planted last fall that reimerged this spring seems to have something eating lower leaves but am not seeing other plant damage so far. Any more specific info on sagebrush vole?\nExpert: Could you please upload photos of the tunnels, runways (surface), and any other sign you're noticing? Also, in what type of vegetation community is your property? (forest, grass/shrubland, proximity to wetland or riparian area) If moles are at work, they can be tunneling without making frequent molehills - which are in part just ways to dispose of excess dirt from tunneling, so you may in fact be seeing surface evidence of a mole at work. Depending on the vegetation community in which your property occurs, vole species in your county could include long-tailed (no burrows), montane (runways in grassland), or sagebrush (clusters of burrows) - all of them are herbivorous.  If you can please send photos, perhaps I can be of more help in id'ing who you've got there. Also keep watch for other sign (such as rabbit pellets) and creatures at night, too (e.g., slugs), which might be providing some of the effects you're noticing.\nUser: I unfortunately do not have any photos at this time, cause I stepped on the runways in the flowerbeds to settle the flowers back in. We are in city limits of Bend, our property in back borders a buried irrigation canal that has some long grasses growing on it, but do not see any burrowing/tunnels in the back of the property or on both sides of the house. We have 7 or 8 juniper trees in back and a maple tree and flower beds/planters in back. We are in a cul-de-sac of houses and our front yard has two maple trees with flower beds under them and then a long flower bed in an L shape with a Japanese maple at the end of the L. It is the front flower beds (L shaped and under maples) that I have seen the ridged tunnels. Kinda reminds me when baking a cake or loaf of banana bread, when done it  is raised with a crack running through it. I will check again tomorrow to see if any new tunnels have shown up and try to get photos. No plant damage I can see, but have seen a couple times some small holes, but not that close to the tunnels. Thank you for responding.CindyOn Mon, Jun 12, 2023, 12:11 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: Thank you - The description is starting to sound like a mole to me, and I'll do a bit more sleuthing - However I will look forward to photos once you're able to upload those.\nUser: I noticed this one after I watered and is not the best example but all I have seen in the last 2 or 3 days. In a flower bed near a maple tree. The grass borders seem to stop it??

It will be good to keep watch for additional sign, but this one looks like a mole that was hunting closer to surface in the border area and then likely \"dove\" deeper while hunting under the grass, thus leaving no surface evidence. Having said that, our knowledge of moles in and east of the Cascades is very thin, so it will be very interesting to see how additional evidence you see develops!\nUser: I never knew moles even existed over here, why I assumed it must be a sagebrush vole; however from descriptions, I also thought mole. I think we had japanese beetles in our front lawn for several years until last spring it seemed that whole half of the lawn just died. We tore out the dead half, laid down coastal mix soil from Instant Landscaping and from exploring found that the beetles will avoid clover so seeded mini clover as an experiment. It seemed to be doing fairly well up through about mid may, this year, then the other half just went dead and I found what I believe may be really small puff balls with a cinnamon colored and textured powder that went everywhere when I was raking out thatch and is now creeping into the clover (and killing that too). Not your area, I know, but am thinking of tearing it all out so may uncover some mole evidence under the clover/lawn. Also why I thought maybe the mole could detect the beetle larvae and moved in??? I also amended parts of the flower beds late last summer with organic bagged garden soil then topped with hemlock bark mulch. These have been the areas where I first saw the rapid tunneling from one end to the other and back again. My daughters boyfriend mentioned yesterday that he believes they also have a mole(s) in their front yard. They live in the Orchard district of Bend about a mile or so from us. An older residential neighborhood that has better soil than much of Bend because there used to be orchards before development. Thank you again. Interesting there is not much info this side of mountains.CindyOn Sat, Jun 17, 2023, 5:42 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

Additionally, the amount of sunlight can influence flower color; more sunlight can sometimes lead to lighter colors.

If the problem persists, you might consider consulting a local arborist or pest control expert for further assistance.\"}"

The water drains through very quickly and does not seem to retain moisture.  The root system is very superficial. This was not occuring before we had raised beds.  We have tried to add compost and some peat moss to help retain the moisture, however to no avail.  \nWe need some advice on how to  prevent the soil from not soaking into the deeper layers and not allowing the plan to access it?  Not really sure if that the problem. We have tested the soil quality and it seems to be fine when to comes to nutrients. There are usually plenty of earthworms as well when we dig the soil.\n\nThank you, Taylor\nExpert: Thank you for your question. I need two additional pieces of information: 1).  How long ago did you make the conversion to a raised bed and where did you get the soil that you put into the raised bed? 2).  If you have had a soil analysis done and have received a soil report, could you please take a picture of the report and send to us?

Here are a few suggestions to improve the situation:\\n\\n1. **Soil Amendment**: Consider adding more organic matter to your soil. While you've already added compost and peat moss, you might need to increase the amount or try different types of organic matter like well-rotted manure or coconut coir, which can help improve water retention.\\n\\n2. **Soil Structure**: Incorporate materials that can help improve soil structure, such as vermiculite or perlite. These can help retain moisture while also improving aeration.\\n\\n3. **Mulching**: Apply a thick layer of mulch on top of the soil. This can help retain moisture, reduce evaporation, and regulate soil temperature.\\n\\n4. **Watering Practices**: Adjust your watering schedule to ensure that the plants receive consistent moisture. Drip irrigation systems can be particularly effective in raised beds.\\n\\n5. **Check for Compaction**: Ensure that the soil is not compacted, as this can also affect root growth and water retention. Gently aerate the soil if necessary.\\n\\n6. **Raised Bed Design**: Ensure that the raised bed has adequate drainage but is not losing water too quickly. Sometimes lining the bottom with a layer of gravel can help slow down drainage.\\n\\nIf you can find the soil analysis report, it might provide additional insights into any specific nutrient imbalances or pH issues that need to be addressed. Let me know if you have any further questions or need more detailed guidance on any of these steps.\"}"

It gets about 2-3 hrs of direct sun a day and a small amount of morning and evening sun, and I have been watering it every 5-7 days with a “gator bag”. It started flowering about 2 weeks ago, but now many of the buds are brown and multiple stems are breaking, including stems that don’t seem to be overly heavy with blooms. I would appreciate any advice! Thank you!\nExpert: Thank you for writing. I believe that your plant is overwatered.  https://plantcaretoday.com/overwatered-hydrangea.html  The leaves  look like edema with swollen cells and dilated veins. Gatorbags are not needed and can make a plant unhealthy. These can aggravate root rot from watering and can cause fungi to enter the stem at the ground level. Remove it.  Some hydrangeas need stem support (just like peonies do).  In this case, caging a plant before stem support is needed is the best approach.  I am worried that this plant may have hydrangea scale--a sap sucking insect. https://www.thegardenersalmanac.co.uk/Content/H/Hydrangea%20Scale%20insect/Hydrangea%20Scale%20Insects.htm These little white things on your image 104 bother me.  Can you send me a close up?\nUser: Hi, Jordan,Thanks so much for your reply! I am including a few more pictures of the stems and leaves. The leaves feel pretty dry and crunchy.I will not use the gator bag anymore! When should I resume watering and how often?

It's good to hear that the plant perked up after you adjusted the watering. Given the current drought conditions, it's important to strike a balance between under and overwatering. Since your hydrangea responded well to drying out slightly before watering, you might want to continue this approach. Monitor the soil moisture by checking the top inch of soil; if it feels dry, it's time to water. Typically, hydrangeas need about 1 inch of water per week, but this can vary with weather conditions. Adjust your watering schedule based on the plant's response and the soil moisture. Keep an eye on the plant's overall health, and if you notice any further issues, feel free to reach out with more pictures or questions.\"}"

Be sure to remove any damaged or misshapen fruit first, and aim to leave about 6 to 8 inches between the remaining apples. This will help ensure that the tree's resources are not spread too thinly. Good luck with your apple trees, and it's wonderful that your daughter is studying biology at OSU—she might find this hands-on experience quite valuable!\"}"

If you have a history of how the pasture has been used in the past, review it. See when the pasture was grazed, how many animals and for how long each growing season.

Since you've already used Crossbow and manual removal, consider the following additional methods:\\n\\n1. **Cultural Control**: Maintain a healthy, competitive ground cover to reduce the establishment of burr cucumber. This can include planting cover crops or maintaining a dense grass sward.\\n\\n2. **Mechanical Control**: Continue with regular mowing or cutting before the plants set seed. This will help prevent seed production and reduce the seed bank in the soil.\\n\\n3. **Chemical Control**: While Crossbow is effective, ensure you are applying it at the right time and under the right conditions for maximum efficacy. Consider consulting with a local extension office for advice on timing and additional herbicide options that might be more effective in your specific area.\\n\\n4. **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor the area for new growth and remove plants promptly to prevent them from establishing.\\n\\n5. **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**: Combine these methods for a more comprehensive approach.

Thank you for your knowledge and service. \n\nI have a client with veronica that has started to die back, both in front, less protected and pretty sunny, and in back where it's very protected. It gets watered reasonably, not over- or under-. Have you seen this where it looks black when it dies? If so, is it natural, or should I be looking for a \"culprit\". It's probably not animals since it's in multiple locations and the back yard is not open to animals entering easily.\nExpert: Dear, Peyton: Thank you for contacting Colorado State University Lawn & Garden Help Desk regarding the veronica. In order for us to assess the situation, we would like to find out a little more about the plant and watering practice.  First, it would be helpful if you can tell us what type of veronica you have growing. Speedwell comes in varieties of size and shade.  Second, if black blotches appear in leaves, those can be simply cut off as long as they are minor blemishes. Fungi are the main cause of those black blotches, and this is mainly due to poor air circulation/overcrowded condition and overwatering. If you can dig up the died-back plants and see what the roots may look like, it would speak a volume. Are the roots dry and not holding onto the soil? Then probably it needs/needed water. Are the roots slimy and soil is saturated? That would be a sign of overwatering. Veronica/speedwell need moderate water when young and being established, and during the dry spell. Once they are established with good watering practice, they are able to handle the stresses of heat and periods of less water; however, that does not mean it is completely drought proof.  I hope this email is a good starting point to investigate the culprit. Thank you. Nat W. Colorado Master Gardener\nUser: Thank you for the information so far. Here's what I can add based on your questions:  The flowers are blue-ish purple. Doing a search by phone it said \"water lettuce\" (ha, ha), but it's more likely Veronica Repens.Cathe dug up both a damaged and healthy section and the roots look the same (holding onto soil, and not slimy or saturated). The area gets watered for about 6 minutes three times a week (if we haven't had rain) with spray-type sprinkler heads. Overcrowding seems like the most likely possibility from what was already mentioned, because they've had the same type of care for at least 15 years. Thoughts? Michele--Michele E.

Since the roots appear healthy and the watering schedule seems appropriate, addressing the overcrowding issue could help. I recommend thinning out the plants to improve air circulation and reduce competition for resources. This can be done by dividing the plants in the spring, which will also promote healthier growth. Additionally, ensure that the plants are not shaded by other vegetation, as this can also affect their health. Regularly removing dead or diseased foliage can help prevent the spread of any potential fungal issues. If the problem persists, consider testing the soil for nutrient deficiencies or pH imbalances that might be affecting the plants.\"}"

(See https://content.ces.ncsu.edu/stem-blight-of-blueberry)  From your picture it seems that your blueberry plants might have leaf rust rather than blight.    Apparently proximity (less than 1/2 mile) to hemlocks is one cause of this rust.  If you haven't planted the bush yet, perhaps it contracted the rust in the nursery.  Is it too late to return it and purchase a more resistant variety? Suncrest is a very reputable nursery.  (It's one of my favorites!)  Several rainy days with temps around 70 seem to encourage the rust spores.  Also very humid days encourage them.   There are  some management options.  Don't water the leaves, just the soil.  Cover during rainy periods.  Make sure the roots can drain well. Raise the planting bed. Use acidic soil.  Remove any leaf litter under the bushes.  Some sources state fungicides are not necessary in Ohio, and others recommend them.  If you decide to use a fungicide in spring, you must follow the directions exactly.  This article says fungicides aren't needed: https://ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/plpath-fru-43 and this article recommends specific fungicides for blueberry rust: https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/beware_of_blueberry_leaf_rust  I'm including a link to the following article because it discusses other blueberry diseases.  There are several diseases with spots on the leaves and maybe your spots will progress to resemble one of the pictures.  It's just FYI    https://content.ces.ncsu.edu/leaf-diseases-of-blueberry  I hope your blueberry bush survives and thrives in the future despite its current spots.  Sincerely,\nUser: Thank you ever so much! Sadly this was the last one of this variety. Rust I can deal with! Yes I love Suncrest. Can I ask another question about a different plant, or do I need to submit a new question?Thank you,Kellie. Sent from my iPhone On Jul 20, 2023, at 15:59, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:﻿\nExpert: Hi, Dakota feel free to ask me another question.\nUser: Thank you…can you help determine what is going on with my blushing turtle germanium?

To manage this, you can take several steps:\\n\\n1. **Cultural Practices**: Ensure good air circulation around your plants by spacing them properly and pruning lower leaves to reduce humidity. Rotate crops and avoid planting tomatoes in the same spot each year.\\n\\n2. **Watering Practices**: Water at the base of the plant to keep foliage dry and reduce the spread of the fungus.\\n\\n3. **Mulching**: Apply mulch around the base of the plants to prevent soil from splashing onto the leaves, which can spread the fungus.\\n\\n4. **Fungicides**: If the problem persists, consider using a fungicide labeled for use against early blight. Be sure to follow the instructions on the label for application rates and timing.\\n\\nImplementing these practices should help manage the disease and improve the health of your tomato plants.\"}"

As for taking a year off from growing squash, it can be beneficial to break the life cycle of the borers, but if you decide to plant again, using preventative measures like wrapping the base of the stems with foil and applying pesticides early in the season can help. Regarding your cucumber plant, while squash borers typically target squash, they can occasionally affect other cucurbits. However, leaf die-off in cucumbers can also be due to other issues like fungal diseases or nutrient deficiencies. Once you send the photos, I can help identify the problem more accurately. In the meantime, ensure your cucumber plant is not overwatered and check for any signs of pests or disease. Best of luck with your garden!\"}"

There are home spray products that have more specific and effective control than the general product you have been using. Just as important is timing your sprays effectively. You can use a tool like Enviroweather https://enviroweather.msu.edu/ to monitor conditions for specific pests and disease in your area based on weather conditions in addition to following the articles published in-season by our extension staff (for you the Northwest MI reports will be best) https://www.canr.msu.edu/fruit/  If you haven't done a soil test recently you should have one done, which would come with recommendations for fertilization. https://homesoiltest.msu.edu/get-started  Your practice of keeping the orchard free from diseased fruit is one you should continue.\nUser: What is causing the damage to my honeycrisp apples?

Although the berries and all parts of the plant are poisenous, it is actually considered to be on the low end of the toxicity scale. In fact, it is of great wildlife value especially to birds that eat the berries. It reproduces by seed, so if you break off the stalk before it flowers you should be able to prevent furthur reproduction. But, if you don't mind having a possibly 8 foot tall plant in your yard, with beautiful purple berries, consider leaving it for the birds...smile!  https://extension.umd.edu/resource/pokeweed  Robin\nUser: THANK YOU so much for your expertise!

When you cut open the black cherry there are small worms or maggots inside the cherry.  I have tried to read articles on the fly problem and their life cycle. How can this cycle be broken and what sprays and when should they be used?  Should the tree be sprayed now with the dead cherries with the maggots inside before they fall to the ground?\nExpert: Hi, Charlie,  It could be the fruit fly or it could be the cherry curculio. If it's the curculio, insecticides have not been found to be effective, but shaking trees to dislodge the adult weevils can be effective (refer to the link above). At this point in the season, as you mentioned, it's too late for any controls.   If it's the Western cherry fruit fly, refer to information from Washington State University. There are insecticides that can control this insect and are applied when you would capture the first females that are flying. You would use yellow sticky traps in late spring (end of May to June) and identify the adults you catch. Spray programs would then start based on the insects you catch.  I have seen more damage to cherries from the curculio than the cherry fruit fly, but this season has new insects, diseases, and issues coming across our desks.\nUser: Thank you for tour response.  I knew there was nothing I could do for this years crop.

Since you mentioned that one-third of the tree is dead and there are branches rubbing near the bottom, I recommend the following steps:\\n\\n1. **Remove Dead Wood**: Cut off all the dead branches. This will help prevent any potential disease from spreading to the healthy parts of the tree.\\n\\n2. **Address Rubbing Branches**: Prune the branches that are rubbing against each other. This will prevent damage to the bark and reduce the risk of disease entry.\\n\\n3. **Maintain Balance**: After removing the dead and rubbing branches, assess the tree's balance. If the tree appears lopsided, you can selectively prune some of the longer branches on the opposite side to help balance the tree's shape.\\n\\n4. **Monitor and Care**: Keep an eye on the tree's health and growth. Ensure it receives adequate water and nutrients, especially since it's producing a large yield this year.\\n\\nIf you're unsure about making these cuts, consulting with a local arborist or a volunteer from a gardening extension service could provide you with hands-on guidance. They can help ensure that the pruning is done correctly and that the tree remains healthy and productive.\"}"

Thank you!\nExpert: Below are two great resources regarding Buffalograss lawns. One is from Colorado State University, the other is from next door at the University of Nebraska. The information is broad and includes management, fertilization, watering, mowing, weed management, and insect/disease management. Both speak to pre- and post-emergent herbicides for Buffalograss.  https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/buffalograss-lawns-7-224/ https://turf.unl.edu/NebGuides/ManageBuffalograssTurfNE_g1947.pdf  Dr. Alison O’Connor at CSU has provided information on the use of herbicides around trees. Please read this prior to applying anything around your trees. https://cmg.extension.colostate.edu/Gardennotes/656.pdf  Regarding the cost, you would need to call for pricing. Big box stores, independent lawn & garden centers, Mudoch’s, Big-R Stores, Agfinity are a few that would source these products and could also let you know liquid vs. granular forms. Finally, there is a website called Do My Own where homeowners can source lawn and garden needs at lower prices. https://www.domyown.com/  Finally, you didn’t mention how large your property is. If it is a small acreage (2 to 100 acres), CSU offers a SAM Program (Small Acreage Management) with a lot of resources. One in particular is the Small Acreage Services Database where you can find contractors for a variety of small acreage services. https://sam.extension.colostate.edu/topics/resources/\nUser: Hello, Peyton info may be useful for you.  Bottom line up-front (BLUF): Ponderosa Pines are very tough evergreens.  We've lived in Watkins Colorado for 20 years now. We had a bad hailstorm on 29 June 2023 causing large amounts of damage to our home and trees. We are in \"Hail Alley\", and this also happened in 2020, and 2015 (I think).  It is very difficult for trees to survive here due to the hail, wind, drought, excessive water, cold, heavy snow & ice storms (It hit -19 degrees F in January I think, this year). We have 2 Ponderosas on our property, and they are the only trees that made it thru the hail storms with little to no evidence of damage. I suspect the long needles helped them absorb the impact of the hail better than the short needle trees.  I'm sending this to you because I've never seen anything that suggested the Pondarosas are good trees for out here, and if people knew how great they are, they would save a lot of money, effort, time & water. Maybe you could help spread the word.  Here is some other info about how our trees held up over the years...  We have a bunch of Austrian Pines that did OK, but definitely lost needles on the North side (Direction the hail came from), The last remaining fir tree didn't make it, totally dead now. It's been struggling for years, and that was the last straw. We had 4 firs, all died over the years. Several of our beautiful Blue Spruce trees are in pretty bad shape now, many needles are gone. I don't know if they'll make it. They've been struggling the past 2 years. We have 2 Scotch Pines, one was protected behind my barn, and is fine. The other lost a lot of needles on the North side. It might make it.  We had 3 Norway Spruce that died after 2 years, about 12 years ago.  As for as deciduous trees, the only ones that are still standing (With an in-tact trunk) are a couple locust trees. One of them has been struggling for ten years, the other one is in decent shape. The leaves on both of them came back after the June 29 hail storm. Both of them have had entire branches die for no apparent reason over the years. On a side note, the Locust trees have actually spawned 2 saplings from seed on their own. One of them was almost entirely eaten by an antelope (I think) and has fully recovered. These are the ONLY trees that have germinated here. Amazing!  My Ash, Maple & Elm? trees all died years ago. I had 3 crimson leaf trees (non-Fruit bearing plums, or something like that) where I believe voles ate the tap roots. Two are still alive, but only the sappers remain (The trunks died). They're bushes now.   I also planted 2 Aspen, which died immediately.  We've lost 90% of the trees we've planted over the last 20 years, and the 2 Ponderosas are the only two that seem to be thriving.    Have a nice day!

It has grown nicely in height since then (from about 7 feet to about 10 feet I'd guess) but has signs of distress in the leaves.  Can you help us understand what the issue is?  We have watered it regularly when first planted and once it started budding out.  Thank you.\nExpert: The marginal (leaf-edge) browning could be from soil moisture stress (too much or too little) or some other environmental stressor; we can't rule out a disease but it's less likely given the type of symptoms. The small amount of skeletonization we see on a branch tip in the third photo may be from sawfly larvae or possibly young caterpillars but they are not going to cause any significant damage and do not need treatment.  With regards to watering, you mentioned having watered regularly, but how often and how much water was applied might be unintentionally over- or under-watering the roots. We recommend that plants be monitored by feeling the soil about six inches deep and watering only when it's becoming somewhat dry to the touch at that depth. (If damp at that depth when checked, the plant probably doesn't need water.) How much water to apply each irrigation session depends on the root ball size and soil drainage but might average around ten gallons for a tree this size. (Hard to judge...a tree-watering bag often holds about 20 gallons that it slowly drips into the root ball, for example.)  We can't quite see the trunk base, but if the lawn grows up to the trunk, we suggest it be removed for at least a foot or two encircling the trunk and mulch put down instead, taking care to not have the mulch contacting the trunk itself. This reduces the risk of mower/weed-whacker damage to the trunk (which can cause serious and untreatable injuries), exposure to lawn herbicides (we considered that a minor exposure to herbicide was responsible for the downward curling some leaves are showing), and reduces root competition with the lawn.  For now, just keep monitoring the roots for watering needs as our drought this year continues. (Recent rains helped, but we're still quite behind on rainfall for the year.) No treatments are needed at this point, and most new plants in the establishment period of their first year or two in the ground succumb to environmental stressors and not a pest or disease (root rot aside, since that begins by saturated conditions leading to opportunistic infection). If you see worsening or new symptoms, feel free to send us additional photos for assessment.  Miri\nUser: Wow, what a thorough and helpful response!!  Thanks very much. We will start checking the moisture level in soil.  (The tree is mulched and we haven't used any herbicides so that shouldn't be an issue.)I am feeling particularly attached to this tree (and the bald cypress we planted at the same time, under Prince George's rebate program) so am grateful to have your advice.  And will check back if we need to.Thank you again,Cheryl On Mon, Jun 26, 2023, 3:15 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

I am one of your MOCO Ask Extension colleagues, and my Master Gardener colleagues could use your help in determining what is affecting some of our plants.\n\nI help manage six cutting garden beds in the Demonstration Garden in Derwood.  Earlier this season, we observed that small portions of the conoclinium coelestinum were turning black and dying, but the rest of the plants were, and remained, healthy.  We cut down the affected stalks to the ground, but that was all.  Occasionally over the summer the condition recurred, but was confined to the conoclinium.\n\nToday, however, I observed that the condition has spread to other beds in the garden.  A large stand of phlox Jena was completely destroyed, and a clump of phlox David next to it also was affected (fortunately, the rest of the David was unaffected and continues to flower nicely).  I also found a good amount of the condition in leucanthemum 'Becky'.  I should note that these affected beds are not next to each other and in fact are a good 30 to 50 feet apart.  Other plants in beds in between the affected areas  are fine and disease free.\n\nI asked other MGs what they thought might be happening, but no one knew for sure.  We all agreed it looked like a disease (no sign of insect infestation), perhaps fungal given that the bottoms of the affected stalks turn black and moist, like they're rotting.  The attached photos will give you an idea.  (I have more photos, but the system will only allow me to attach these three.)  If it's a fungus, perhaps it's been exacerbated by the alternating dry and wet weather we've had.  I've been working in these beds for many years, and I have never encountered this before.\n\nWhat do you think is causing this?  Is there a treatment?  As mentioned, we've confined ourselves to cutting down the affected stalks to the ground--since these are perennials we've avoided pulling them out by their roots.\n\nYour help will be greatly appreciated!\n\nBob Loesche\nExpert: Hi, Emerson,  Our plant pathologist had a look and agrees that cutting back the foliage is helpful and also recommended digging one or a little section of one - maybe the part of the plant where the rest looks healthy still ( try to take a spade and cut that wedge of the plant and roots out) so you can examine it for Southern Blight nodules on the roots.  It could also be a wilt disease like Verticillium which given the weather patterns like you mentioned could have stressed the plants and caused the infection and in that case they would have to be removed. Did you notice any reddish center or streaking in the cut stems? Maybe you could cut some more to look.  Garden phlox unfortunately get so many ailments so it is difficult to say for sure when they are this far gone.  Examine some of the roots and see if you notice anything and feel free to send more photos.  Emily\nUser: Emily, thanks so much for your prompt response.  I will look more closely at the plants as you suggest.  Unfortunately my colleagues and II won't be back in Derwood until next Tuesday, but I'll keep you posted as to what we find. Thanks again,BobOn Wed, Jul 26, 2023 at 3:46 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nUser: Hi, Emerson.  Yesterday, I had another Master Gardener take some photos of the roots and leaves of our diseased plants, attached.  Do these in any way help you diagnose the problem?    Fortunately we didn't have any major spread of the disease over the last week, although there were a few spots where there was new die-back. Thanks,Bob\nExpert: Hi, Emerson,  The white fungal threads are probably mycorrhizal in nature or are decaying the mulch itself; they don't appear to be tied to disease and we do not see Southern Blight spores in the images. Some other form of crown rot is still possible, and we also suspect root rot may be involved, given that several roots pictured have the cortex showing (the stringy inner core) as they have lost their outer layer, a typical symptom associated with root rot diseases.  The leaf spot might be Cercospora (the symptoms of several pathogens can look alike) but this would not cause rampant plant dieback, only cosmetic damage to foliage that does not need treatment. Removing the infected shed foliage in autumn and discarding, not composting it, may reduce re-infection odds next year, though it's not a foolproof approach.  Miri\nUser: Miri, thanks so much for this info.   If the problem is indeed some form of root rot, can that be caused by overwatering?  All the beds in the Demo Garden are watered by a drip line system, but it's not a precise system and I wouldn't be surprised if there are spots where too much water is applied.  Having said that, we didn't immediately observe that the areas with plant die-back were unduly wet.  We weren't looking for that, but if there were really wet spots chances are we would have noticed.  In any event, I thought I'd ask in case overwatering is something we should look out for.Beyond checking watering, is there any other response we can take besides promptly discarding the affected plants?BobOn Fri, Aug 4, 2023 at 5:08 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

Additionally, improving soil drainage and ensuring good air circulation around the plants can help mitigate root rot issues. If you notice any specific patterns in the dieback related to watering, adjusting the drip line system accordingly could be beneficial.

The plant is several years old (it has been cut back to the ground a couple times for various reasons.  It is in well-draining soil and a clay pot.  The root ball is maybe an inch or two smaller than the pot.  I use a 50-50-50 each watering per the instructions for continuous fertilizing.  For the spider mites, I have tried neem oil, homemade and commercial insecticidal soaps, and I've also used systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid .22%), following the directions.  The plant is very fragrant and the dew it releases is, I'm sure, extremely attractive to insects.  They attack all aged leaves equally, even the new growth that should be covered by the systemic insecticide.   Additionally, I have random middle-aged leaves yellowing and dying.  I suspect it might be that I use tap water, so I am going to try run filtered water through.  But the bugs are the chronic concern.

Additionally, ensure that the plant is not over-fertilized, as this can also cause leaf yellowing. You might want to check the pH of the soil as well, as Passiflora prefers slightly acidic to neutral soil. For the spider mites, consistency is key. Regularly applying neem oil or insecticidal soap every 7-10 days can help break the life cycle of the mites. Ensure thorough coverage of the leaves, including the undersides where mites often hide. Increasing humidity around the plant can also deter spider mites, as they thrive in dry conditions. Consider misting the plant or placing a humidity tray nearby. If you move the plant outdoors, be cautious of its exposure to direct sunlight and wind, which can stress the plant and make it more susceptible to pests. Regular monitoring and maintenance will be crucial in managing these issues.\"}"

Some of the grass is coming in nicely while other areas aren’t coming in as well as you can see in the attached images. \n1)\tWould you recommend I re-seed areas that aren’t coming in as well ASAP or would you wait a little longer? Because all the grass was planted on the same day, I’d assume since some new grass is already 1” tall, that if the seed was going to germinate it would have done so by now. I’m worried if I wait to long I’ll miss the window to get the seed down.\n2)\tWould you recommend I wait to re-seed if I can’t put seed down without walking on the new grass?\n3)\tWhen I re-seed, would you recommend I continue to water frequently to keep the newest grass seed moist, despite it probably being best to reduce the watering frequency for the recently germinated grass?\n4)\tI’m wondering why some areas germinated well and other’s did not. I’m thinking that a couple reasons some areas did not germinate well were\na.\tThey did not get as much water from the impact sprinkler.\nb.\tMaybe the seed to soil contact was not as good as it could have been. I only scarified the soil, threw seed down, and watered it frequently.\nI saw on the UMD website that verticutting and aerating the soil before re-seeding can help get good seed to soil contact. My concern is that if the seed drops to the bottom of the hole or slit, won’t it be too far under to germinate? I thought covering your seed with more than 1/4” of soil was too deep; but with a aerator the seed could be dropped up to 2” below the soil.\n\nAny guidance greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks!\nEddie\nExpert: Hi, Morgan,  You could re-seed the areas that aren't coming in well. Maybe it just didn't take like you mentioned the seed to soil contact didn't quite line up. Aerating is good to relieve soil compaction. and while some seed may fall down into the holes it will still help with overall germination, especially if a soil test revealed that it is low in nutrients and you need to add organic matter.  You could water as needed to keep the new seed moist enough to germinate. It shouldn't effect the germinated seed too much to the point of a disease or fungal growth.  If you didn't aerate and the soil is compacted, you could use a garden fork and work it into the ground in the areas that didn't germinate before you overseed again. Then rake the seed evenly over the area.  Emily\nUser: Good Evening Emily! Thanks for the suggestions. Does that mean I don't need to worry too much about stepping on the new grass when I overseed it with a rotary spreader? Thanks! Eddie"

The salesman told me I should use this water bag to water the tree, as it does a much better job than a hose. He said if you run the water too fast, it will disrupt the soil around the tree. (Really? I've run the hose on tiny shoots in my vegetable garden and they grew fine.) And if you run it too slow, it will, of course, take a long time to water. What's the scoop? Is this a useful product or just a gimmick? Also, this bag is made of plastic, and being the tree-hugging (joke intended), earth loving guy that I am, I am trying to use as little plastic as possible. I have the receipt and the packaging is unopened, so I can return it if I want to. Also, can you provide instructions on how often to water this tree?\nExpert: Making sure that the tree is well planted and cared for afterwards is important for establishment and long term success. While I know you won't be doing the actual planting, it's worth reading through our page on planting: https://extension.umd.edu/resource/planting-tree-or-shrub/, particularly in relation to planting depth- you want to be able to see the root flare before it goes into the ground/mulch. (Mulch should be no deeper than 2-4 inches and kept pulled back from contact with the trunk).  The water bags are not a gimmick, but are useful for people who won't/can't  water their trees for some reason.  Here is our page on Watering Trees and Shrubs:  https://extension.umd.edu/resource/watering-trees-and-shrubs/  Keeping an eye on your new tree and watering when needed is important for the first 24 months of establishment. Unpredictable/changing climate conditions makes this even more important as the last few years have had periods of prolonged drought, heat-stress as well as deluges of rain.  Red maples are gorgeous native trees.  The Marylander's Plant Trees program offers a $25 off coupon for select native trees at participating nurseries. It may be too late to use the coupon but it wouldn't hurt to ask.... or get another tree!

When I purchased the home three years ago, the former owners had let the lawn go to dirt and weeds. The back half of my lawn (which has more shade thanks to a big maple tree), has grown grass just fine, but the other half (which receives mostly sun) has been patchy, bumpy, and filled with weeds (crabgrass, clover, and prostrate spurge) and browning grass. The lawn has several patches (2-4 feet wide) that will not grow anything--not even weeds! The bare patches seem to be getting bigger. I have attempted all sorts of solutions over the past three years -- different grass seeds, mulch, fertilizer, lime, weed/crabgrass preventer, daily watering, and more. I have some patches of ants that are preventing grass growth near the patio, but the largest bare areas in the middle of the lawn show no clear evidence of ants, though the soil does seem a bit sandy. I have also tested the soil with an at-home test kit in several spots and it indicated that the soil has a neutral pH. I looked at the \"diagnose a problem\" portion of your website and did not see anything that quite resembled my grass. I have exhausted my (limited) expertise, and am hoping someone can point me toward a solution. Thank you!!\nExpert: I have forwarded your question to an expert in the Turf science program at the University of Minnesota, it will take about a week for her to answer. Thanks for sending in your question.\nExpert: Hi, Peyton. Thanks for sending the pictures along with your questions. If lawns were not healthy going into these last three years of drought, it's no wonder you're having trouble. The weeds I see in the photo are indicative of dry soil and especially the knot weed is very invasive. Crabgrass, clover and ants can be dealt with. Follow directions below for weeds, and pick up a granular ant killer that you can get at any hardware store. Ants are also indicators of dry soil.  Here's where I'll start.  1. Get a good soil test done, one that tells you about nutrients, soil texture, and micronutrients. Specify micronutrients when you order, this is not always done. Three options (but not the only ones) are Soil RX, Yard Mastery and the UMN Soil Test Lab https://soiltest.cfans.umn.edu/ . Use the results to find the appropriate soil amendments you'll need and fertilizer for the spring. 2. Next week or as soon after as the heat allows, treat the weeds. The ground needs to be free of weeds. Triclopyr and Trimec will take care of these weeds. Don't wait longer than the next week or so or your new grass seed will not take.  3. Wait the length of time on the labels, up to 3 weeks. If there is regrowth - respray and wait. Watch the calendar -- the seed I'm going to recommend should go down no later than September 15th - BUT if there are weeds, do not seed the lawn, treat the weeds until the ground is clear.  4. If the ground is clear by September 15th, get a good brand of Turf-type tall fescue and Kentucky Bluegrass mix. One example is the Tuff Turf mix by Twin City Seed. This is a local company that only sells the best-rated grass seeds from national trials. You can purchase this from them directly or Beisswengers Hardware or Bachmans. JRK is sold by Gertens, and I'm sure you will find that a decent seed as well. For more location choices check out the Turf Science website at the U. Don't spend money at the local hardware store, the seed is typically the poorest rated. Kim Sullivan UMNTurf Science Group\nUser: Thank you so much for this great advice. We have purchased a recommended soil test and will be taking care of the weeds this weekend.  Best,HelenHelen Young Kouba 651.307.9126  | <personal data hidden>On Wed, Jul 26, 2023 at 9:19 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

Use caulk or weather stripping to seal these entry points.\\n\\n2. **Reduce Humidity**: Silverfish thrive in humid environments, so using a dehumidifier in damp areas like basements can help deter them.\\n\\n3. **Regular Cleaning**: Continue with regular cleaning, especially in less frequently used areas like basements and attics, to remove any potential hiding spots for these pests.\\n\\n4. **Natural Repellents**: Consider using essential oils like peppermint or tea tree oil, which can act as natural repellents. You can mix a few drops with water and spray it around baseboards and other entry points.\\n\\n5. **Sticky Traps**: Place sticky traps in areas where you've noticed activity. This can help monitor and reduce the population of these pests.\\n\\nBy focusing on these non-toxic methods, you can help keep your home pest-free while ensuring the safety of the wildlife outside.

I seem to mostly get on my all KBG side. I’ve only used certified weed seed after my reno, so not sure if it’s from the soil, animals, etc. But depending on what it is will depend on how I treat it. Also, my neighbor across street has a whole crap ton of it, so it might be the same thing and I could help him as well\nExpert: Grassy weed ID can be tricky due to small differences in physical features, especially from photos, but the traits we see suggest Orchardgrass, a common perennial cool-season grass. Management options are included in the linked page. Was any straw used to cover the seed last time the lawn was seeded/overseeded? Perhaps it had some weed seed, or as you suggested, maybe seeds blew-in from nearby yards if more Orchardgrass is growing there and its seed heads weren't mowed off before they matured.  Miri\nUser: No, I did not use any straw nor will I ever use any straw for that very reason. I did bring in a mixture of topsoil, sand, compost when I did my renovation, and I used the highest quality certified Bluegrass seed that Mountain View seeds makes. I used their 365ss blend.  ----------------------------------- Jason\nExpert: Ok, perhaps it seeded-in from another yard or open space, then, when mature Orchardgrass went to seed. For the future, if you aren't already, we suggest you consult with the recommended turfgrass cultivars publication (updated every summer) that lists which varieties of each turf type have performed best in Maryland conditions. Overseeding in autumn with those will help keep the lawn vigorous and dense enough to out-compete most weeds on its own. (High quality seed is good to use too of course, but depending on how customized that supplier's blend was for mid-Atlantic or \"transition zone\" climate, it might not include varieties well-suited to our challenging conditions. Typically, we suggest MD lawns be comprised of a majority tall fescue and very little Kentucky bluegrass, unless someone is willing to have a high-maintenance lawn.)  Miri\nUser: Well, fortunately, every single cultivar that I’ve used for fescue and Bluegrass are all on the proven list that you sent me below. Most of my turf is pretty thick, but the majority of where I have issues is around my tree where it doesn’t grow nearly as well and it’s really thin. I was wondering if adding dirt in that area would help grass be able to establish better.  CURRENT KBG GOOD AREA CURRENT KBG AROUND TREE ----------------------------------- Jason"

Can I be certain it is not poison hemlock? Is every single part of poison hemlock always completely hairless?\nExpert: Hi, Taylor think that this appears to be poison hemlock but can't be certain. Either way, if it's an undesirable weed in your yard/garden, it may not matter much if it's poison hemlock since you still need to physically or chemically get rid of it, and one should always be careful removing unidentified weeds anyway in case the sap (or thorns, bristles, etc.) irritates the skin. All parts of this plant are poisonous if ingested and the sap can hurt some people if it comes in contact with their skin.  If they don't want to go near it, then at least being biennial it will die on its own at the end of this year, assuming this is its second year of growth. Then, all you have to do is prevent it from producing seed by cutting off any flower heads. Treat it like you would when dealing with poison ivy to be safe.  https://marylandgrows.umd.edu/?s=poison+hemlock https://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/72766.html https://bygl.osu.edu/index.php/node/1935 Emily\nUser: Thank you, I'm glad I wasn't the only one uncertain about it.

If present, you might consider using a fungicide suitable for houseplants. Ensure good air circulation around the plant to prevent fungal growth.\\n\\n2. **Light and Location**: Peace lilies prefer bright, indirect light. Moving it away from the floor vent is a good idea, as drafts can stress the plant. Try to find a spot with consistent, indirect light.\\n\\n3. **Watering**: Ensure you are not overwatering. Peace lilies like to dry out slightly between waterings. Check the top inch of soil; if it's dry, it's time to water.\\n\\n4. **Leaf Removal**: You can remove damaged leaves to help the plant focus its energy on new growth. If most leaves are damaged, remove the worst ones and leave some to continue photosynthesis.\\n\\n5. **Fertilizer**: Since the soil feeds for up to six months, additional fertilizer isn't necessary right now. Monitor the plant's response to the current conditions before making any changes.\\n\\nI hope these steps help your peace lily recover.

Thank you\nExpert: Overall, the sapling appears to be in good shape. The minor amount of leaf yellowing and shedding is typical for birch in our summers, and can be exacerbated by the roots getting too dry, since birch appreciate more evenly-moist soils. When monitoring for watering needs, feel the soil around six inches deep in the tree's root zone, watering well only once it has become somewhat dry to the touch at that depth. Several gallons of water per watering session will likely be needed to thoroughly soak the root zone. How often it will dry enough to need watering will greatly depend on weather and soil type, but as a rough guideline, a moisture-loving plant this size might need checking at least twice a week in hot, rainless weather.  The pale lumps on the foliage are not in focus so we can't quite tell what the symptoms look like, but they resemble galls made by mites, which are very common and occur on a wide variety of trees and shrubs. Despite being a bit of an eyesore, mite galls are not a serious threat to plant health and can be ignored. (Treatment would not remove them at this point anyway.) Raking-up and disposing of the tree's fallen leaves this autumn might reduce mite numbers for next year, but it's not guaranteed, since they can also disperse on the wind, being so tiny.

First, ensure that you are not over-applying the fertilizer, as excessive nitrogen can lead to rapid top growth at the expense of root development. You might also consider supplementing with a root-stimulating product that contains phosphorus, which is crucial for root development. Additionally, proper watering practices are essential; deep and infrequent watering encourages roots to grow deeper into the soil. Aerating your lawn can also help improve root growth by allowing better penetration of water and nutrients. Finally, applying the triple fertilizer later in the spring, as you mentioned, can help balance the growth between the roots and the grass blades.\"}"

My landlord insists on watering every day running all zones for 15 min each.  The lawn is new sod that was put down over sandy clay without much if any soil amendment.  The landlord had the sprinkler system installed and has found that he has to water daily to keep the lawn thick and green to his liking.  He only has a few weeks of the lawn being in this condition which was just before  moved in.  I cut the system back to every third day as tie lawn was too wet to cut.  and area in the front that gets all day sun started to tunn brown so he insisted on going back to 1 min every day saying it would come back because it did before.  What he fails to realize is that he also fertilized when he started watering daily.  The lawn was green but it started to turn brown as soon as we cut it.  I did not take much off in fact it was still pretty long but the it continued to turn brown and now he is back to watering every day.   The pictures show how it looked after he fertilized and was watering every day for at least three weeks.  The next two photos show what happened when it missed watering to 4 days.  I keep trying to tell him the lawn will not establish a health root system because the sod was put down over sandy clay.  He replied that he put top soil down on top of the grass to take care if that and I think it is now part of the problem.  Is there any reason to water a lawn every day for 15 minutes each zone.  All the zones are not separated between sun and shade areas so of you run a zone the has full sun more you are also over watering a shady area that does not need the water.   Some of the shady areas are turning brown and I think it is because they are always wet and they are wet when we cut the grass.  Please advise"

Here are some recommendations:\\n\\n1. **Adjust Watering Schedule**: Water deeply but less frequently. This encourages roots to grow deeper into the soil. For sandy clay soil, watering every 2-3 days might be more appropriate, depending on the weather conditions.\\n\\n2. **Monitor Soil Moisture**: Check the soil moisture before watering. If the soil is still moist, delay watering. You can use a soil moisture meter or simply check by hand.\\n\\n3. **Separate Zones**: If possible, adjust the sprinkler system to water sunny and shady areas separately. Shady areas typically require less water.\\n\\n4. **Fertilization**: Be cautious with fertilization. Over-fertilizing can lead to rapid growth that the roots cannot support, especially if the watering is not adequate.\\n\\n5. **Mowing Practices**: Ensure the lawn is not mowed too short, as this can stress the grass, especially if it's already struggling.\\n\\n6. **Topsoil Application**: If topsoil was added on top of the sod, ensure it is not smothering the grass. The sod should be in contact with the soil beneath to establish roots.\\n\\nBy adjusting these practices, you should see an improvement in the lawn's health over time.

Thank you\nExpert: Thanks for your question. In order for me to provide you with accurate information, I would like to see a copy of the soil report.  Could you please provide us with a picture of it? Many thanks.\nUser: Here is soil test.    Nancy   From: ask=<personal data hidden> <ask=<personal data hidden>> On Behalf Of Ask ExtensionSent: Thursday, August 1, 2024 11:12 AMTo: Nancy Melink <<personal data hidden>>Subject: Re: low potassium soil (#0149643)\nExpert: Thanks much for the report.  Will look it over and get back to you with a detailed analysis.  For the interim, there really is nothing to be concerned about regarding the potassium levels.  Details to follow. Thanks again for the report and thanks for consulting with us.\nExpert: Thanks again for the soil test. Upon looking over what you sent, it is not completely clear to me what you are asking. Potassium level is one thing, but is there something else? On the soil report there is some writing. Perhaps it’s yours? Directions for your front yard about letting it grow longer and sharpening the mower blades are spot on. Whatever you think may be wrong with your yard, aeration is not necessary. You have a very healthy organic matter (OM) content of 11.4%. To achieve this high level, my guess is that you leave your grass cuttings on the yard and/or mulch your fall leaves. Whatever. Both are very sound practices. Continue them. With this high OM level, aeration is not necessary. I am slightly puzzled by the writing of adding gypsum. Chemically it is calcium sulfate. It has nothing to do with potassium. It is often used to break up clay-compacted soils and to provide calcium to your yard. Because of the high level of organic material (11.4%) in your yard, I don’t see any need for gypsum. I would suggest that you disregard the comments about gypsum. See: https://www.masterclass.com/articles/gypsum-applications-explained https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-use-gypsum-in-gardening-5079656 As to your potassium level, the soil report suggested 4 pounds potassium per 1,000 square feet. Potassium is usually added as potash. If you look in gardening centers, you will typically find potash labeled “Muriate of Potash”, 0-0-60. If you closely look at the product label, you should see that it is potassium carbonate (KCO3). Consistent with the product label, one pound of the product contains 0.6 pounds (60%) of potassium. It comes as a powder. See: https://www.cropnutrition.com/resource-library/what-is-potash/ The recommendation for potassium was 4 pounds per 1,000 square feet. So measure your yard and determine its total square footage. Suppose it turns out to be 1,250 square feet. If so, you will need to add (4)x(1.250) = 5 pounds of potassium to it. In every pound of muriate of potash there is 0.6 pounds of potassium. So for a yard that is 1,250 square feet, you would apply slightly over 8 pounds of potash. I got this number by dividing 5 by 0.6 But in a broader content, the soil in your yard is quite acceptable even with a low potassium level. I really don’t see any major issue. So my question to you is why would you want to do anything? What do you currently find troublesome about your turf?” Thanks for your question. If you feel that there is some follow-up that needs to be addressed, we will attempt to assist you. If you elect to do nothing about the potassium levels, no harm would be incurred. Good luck\nUser: Thank you for your thoughtful response.    I am sending a couple photos to show area of concern  which is in our front yard, which has very little shade. ( Our back yard grass is much better as it has more shade.)  Low potassium as our only out of range nutrient, as you said doesn’t add up as the only culprit.  We think our watering practices over the last 3 years or so are  part of the problem (especially last years dry spell)  We didn’t water deep enough and too frequent,  is what we are thinking .  We are going to put a rain guage out there when we water to insure 1 inch once a week, unless rain occurs.  We also 2 days ago fertilized according to a lawn experts advice at Martys Farm Service in Elk River.  This included a potash application, a small amount of gypsum for sulpher, and a 2 part application of a 19-19-19 blend.  This is a one time “remedial” fertilization.  Next year we will do 27-0-7 application 3x/year.  Thanks again!   From: ask=<personal data hidden> <ask=<personal data hidden>> On Behalf Of Ask ExtensionSent: Sunday, August 4, 2024 10:27 PMTo: Nancy Melink <<personal data hidden>>Subject: Re: low potassium soil (#0149643)"

        "value": "User: Dear, Charlie: \n\nI am sorry for bombarding you with questions,  I am a relatively new gardener, just started a couple of years ago.  \n\nClover: I have read that clover in the yard is actually beneficial, so I want to keep as much of it as possible. However, it is literally all over and around the Carex Pennsylvania and the Deschampsia Cespitosa I planted last fall from plugs.  I removed a bunch of it today to at least be able to see the sedges and the Deschampsia, but I am wondering if the clover was actually helping those plants.  How much distance should I try to maintain between the clover and my beloved grass-like perennials? \n\nBoxwood:  I have several brown/completely dried out patches in a number of the boxwood plants that pre-existed before I moved into this house,  They did just fine for over a decade since I.be been here in this house.  I also saw similar neon patches on boxwoods near Chevy Chase Circle by Connecticut Ave.  I wonder if there is a disease affecting local boxwoods this year.  Do you have any suggestions for what I should do with the brown patches?\n\nCut-leaf Coneflower:  My Rudbeckia Lacianata grew to nearly 8 ft tall the last two seasons.  They are amazing and flowered profusely, but with the rain or heavy winds they tended to flop over, in many cases bringing down the stakes I had laboriously installed to support the plants and hurting other nearby plants.  Can I cut the plants a bit to control, the height this year?  If so, by how much would be safe? Also, am I correct to assume that I should make the cuts right above one of the nodes where the leaves come off of the stems?  Also, this year I’m seeing recurrent aphids on the stems, it’s making the leaves curl up and some have become droopy. I’ve been spraying them with diluted soap solution.  I wonder if there’s a way to keep teh aphids away for more than a day or two.  \n\nThanks a lot in advance\nLubna\nExpert: Hi, Quinn,  The clover in the lawn is fine to leave. It isn't a native species but is an acceptable lawn alternative for many or to mix with turf type grass. With it creeping into your beds though, you may want to remove it since it can really take over spaces. Yes, it is beneficial in a sense because it is a nitrogen fixing plant and can add nitrogen back into the soil but that doesn't happen until the clover is cut and turned back into the soil. Do you have a photo or could you provide one for this space? Maybe we could recommend where you should keep and remove the clover.  For Boxwoods you can refer to our Boxwood diagnostic page to examine your plants and learn about the various ailments that can affect boxwoods. There isn't a set disease that is contaminating boxwoods this year, but boxwoods are susceptible to various disease and pests. Often times, boxwoods are trimmed and sheared on their outer leaf growth which cause dieback on the interior branches and stress the plants, making them susceptible to pests and diseases. If you learn and practice some proper pruning techniques, then the boxwoods should be ok. You can prune out the brown or dead branches, and try to open up the shrubs to increase air flow. The orange color is most likely old winter damage, which can stay on the leaves until the plant pushes out new growth and those leaves fall off. If you can send a photo of the boxwoods too, that may help us determine if more issues may be at play. Rudbeckia laciniata is a great plant to 'Chelsea Chop' in May to help control it from flopping over later on. Chelsea Chop is a term gardeners use to trim back perennials that can get really tall or to control bloom time. Usually it is done in May which is when the famous Chelsea Flower Show takes place in England and how the term came about. Rudbeckia laciniata can grow really tall and if you prune them back to about half or even 12 - 18 inches, they will grow up again and not be so prone to flopping over later into the summer. You can also let some keep growing now and bloom and prune others to have them bloom later or even help hold up the taller stems. Going back to a leaf node is the general practice, but in my experience, you don't have to be too specific about it and can just trim them back.  For the aphids, this is typical, and not too much concern. You don't need to spray with the soapy water, just a strong blast from your garden hose should be fine, plus if you are trimming off the foliage that should help take care of them too. Usually beneficial predator insects will find the aphids and take care of them before they do a lot of harm. If you see their population increasing or not seeming to get better, you could attempt an insecticidal soap (not soapy water). Insecticidal soap will kill on contact so just be sure to read the label directions and be cautious when spraying to make sure it doesn't hit wanted insects. If you see ladybird (ladybugs) beetles (or their larvae) or praying mantis, those are great predators! Feel free to send back any photos for help with additional recommendations.  Emily\nUser: Emily, thank you  SO MUCH for this incredibly thorough and clear response to my questions.  I will take pictures this weekend and share them with you. Thanks also for the links for additional information.  It is June already but I will go ahead and Chelsea Chop some of my Rudbeckia Laciniatas.   It’s great to know that I don’t have to be so particular about how I cut the stems.   I will study the pruning technique info you sent more carefully before attempting to prune the boxwoods. I didn’t know that clover was not native and that it does not fix nitrogen while it’s  growing normally.  So I will definitely rescue my plants from it.  Will send you pictures soon.  Thanks again a ton for your tremendous help.LubnaOn Thu, Jun 1, 2023 at 3:36 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nUser: Emily, I’m attaching a few pictures of the dead boxwood patches and the clover, though I’ve already removed a bunch of it from around the deschampsia but not the American Beak Grain grass, as you can see.  Initially I had thought I could use the clover as living mulch around some of my plants, but looks like it is more likely to rob them of space and doesn’t even add nitrogen to the soil until it is cut and added back tp the soil as you said.     I have never pruned my boxwoods before, but I should cut out the dead parts, correct?    Finally, even though we’re already in June, I Chelsea Chopped my cut-lead coneflower, especially since I had already severely damaged the leaves and stems by using soap water following some unwise advice on you tube.  I’m now trying to wash off the aphids, but they keep coming back in droves and make the leaves curl up or droop.    Thanks again so much for your help Lubna"

Great question. Bell peppers (Capsicum annuum) can indeed come in different colors such as green, yellow, orange, and red, and these colors are typically a result of the ripening process. All these colors can come from the same plant. Green peppers are simply unripe peppers, and as they ripen, they can turn yellow, then orange, and finally red. The different colors are due to the chlorophyll breaking down and other pigments becoming more prominent as the pepper ripens. So, if you buy a yellow pepper plant and pick the peppers when they are still green, they are essentially the same as green peppers. I hope this helps settle the debate! Have a wonderful day!\"}"

Over time though, the circling roots can actually choke the tree and cut off it's ability to circulate water and nutrients.  The reason I mention the deep planting of the tree is because you might see some issues with the tree down the road. Many issues in trees can be attributed to incorrect planting of the tree, even many years after the tree was transplanted. If the tree is small enough, you could consider replanting the tree, following these guidelines: https://static.colostate.edu/client-files/csfs/pdfs/TreePlanting_636.pdf. Afterwards, it's important to care for the recently transplanted tree correctly (more information here: https://cmg.extension.colostate.edu/Gardennotes/635.pdf). Otherwise, you could leave it as is and hope for the best, although managing a tree is easier when it's smaller than larger! Hopefully that helps!

One option is to apply a non-toxic, squirrel-repellent spray to the clothesline.

Another approach is to install a physical barrier, such as a PVC pipe or metal conduit, around the clothesline. This can make it difficult for squirrels to grip and chew on the line. Additionally, consider placing the clothesline in a more open area, away from trees and structures that provide easy access for squirrels. If you have birdfeeders, try using squirrel-proof designs or placing them further away from the clothesline to reduce attraction. These methods can help maintain an environmentally friendly approach while protecting your clothesline.\"}"

You can use row covers or cloches to trap heat around the plants, especially during cooler nights.\\n\\n2. **Pruning**: Remove some of the leaves to allow more sunlight to reach the fruit, which can help with ripening.\\n\\n3. **Ethylene Gas**: Tomatoes ripen faster in the presence of ethylene gas. You can pick the green tomatoes and place them in a paper bag with a ripe banana or apple, which emits ethylene, to encourage ripening.\\n\\n4. **Consistent Watering**: Ensure that your plants are receiving consistent watering, as fluctuations can stress the plants and affect fruit development.\\n\\n5. **Check for Pests or Diseases**: Sometimes, pests or diseases can affect the plant's ability to ripen fruit. Inspect your plants for any signs of these issues.\\n\\nBy implementing these strategies, you should see an improvement in the ripening of your tomatoes. Good luck, and happy gardening!\"}"

In the last couple of years it seems like they are taking over everything.  In my food plot, for deer, knapweed now covers about 1/3 of it and it has taken root in my hayfield.  Other invasive plants that I have come across in my food plot and in our wild flower beds are. White campion, garlic mustard, Philadelphia fleabane, common wintercress, and stinging nettle.  Any recommendations please let me know.\n\nThank you for your time.\nExpert: Your options are going to depend on your food crop plants. Grasses will have options for chemical control of these plants, broadleaf species (e.g. soybeans, clover, etc.) will not. If you could rotate to an exclusively grass planting for a year or more you could use some of the synthetic auxins (e.g. triclopyr, 2,4-D, dicamba) to get these species under control and then rotate back to a mixed planting.  In the flower beds, physical removal is always an option, though challenging for some perennials. Spot spraying with a broadspectrum product (e.g. glyphosate) or dabbing it on would also be options. Unfortunately there are no preemergence approaches if you want native plant seeds to be able to emerge. Of the species listed, spotted knapweed and garlic mustard are the ones classified as invasive by the State of Michigan. As such, there may be some programs to aid in the management of these species. You can check with your local CISMA (see below) to see if they have any programs or local advise for these species. You can also check with your local conservation district, Genesse Conservation District (https://www.geneseecd.org/).   Cooperative Invasive Species Management Areas (CISMAS).  In Michigan there are several groups working to eradicate invasive plant species. Each group covers a cluster of counties and is funded by varying sources, some volunteer efforts, and sometimes property owners themselves. Groups have varying priority species and their abilities to help vary. If they are not able to help with a particular species of interest they still may be able to point you toward local, reputable companies that can help. You can find your CISMA at this site: https://www.michigan.gov/invasives/take-action/local-resources Usually there is a coordinators email and phone number listed and sometimes there is also a web address (or you can do an internet search for the group’s name).   Please let me know if you have any questions.\nUser: Hello, Riley, Thank you for getting back to me.  It is very concerning to me the number of plants that I'm finding on our little 10 acre parcel.  The last couple of years we have been cutting vines growing up a number of the trees.  These vines were overtaking the canopies.  Some of the vines were almost 2 inches in diameter.  I have not identified these vines yet, but am going to assume they are an invasive species as well. Two more plants that I've come across are the pokeweed and the black swallow-wort.  It's unbelievable how quickly they can take over an area.  Are either of these 2 plants considered invasive by the State of Michigan? My food plot is approximately 1/4 of an acre in size and the knapweed covers about 60% of it.  Clover is what I'm trying to grow in the plot.  We then have a narrow field that is close to 2 acres in size.  We have a friend who cuts and bales it for his cattle.  The knapweed has started to take over this field now. Because of the level of knapweed in the field, the farmer will not cut and bale it.  Says the cows just spit it out when they come in contact with it.Thank you for the additional information. ScottOn Thu, Jun 1, 2023 at 4:34 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: Scott,   Pokeweed is a native species, so not invasive and if in an area that is not frequented it is providing ecosystem services.  Black swallow-wort is classified as an invasive species. Here is where you can check out the lists: https://www.michigan.gov/invasives/id-report/plants  If you can send/attach photos of the foliage on the vines you haven't identified I might be able to help with that.   I think in these fields renovation might be the only way to get the knapweed under control. Kill everything off, make sure you effectively controlled the knapweed and then replant. There may still be some that emerge from the seedbank, so you would need to be scouting and spot spraying after that as necessary. If this is a route you decide to consider you would not want to use a synthetic auxin as previously described because it will prohibit you from successfully reseeding the clover do to carryover. In this situation glyphosate would likely be the best option. You could consider doing this to half you field at a time, but you don't want to let the half not being treated go to seed or it could disperse into the half you're trying to clean up.  Is the narrow two acre field also clover?\nUser: Hi, Riley, So pokeweed is not invasive?  It spreads and can take over an area very quickly.  My wife has been working on a couple of wildflower areas, nothing big, and that pokeweed pretty much took over one of them.  They were close to 5 feet tall.As for the narrow 2 acre parcel, we've been just letting it grow and then a farmer comes in and cuts and bales it. Starting 2 years ago he would not cut 1/2 to 3/4 of an acre because there was a little too much knapweed in it and his cows would just spit it out.  The farmer said he wasn't going to be able to cut and bale it for at least a month.  With the knapweed already flowering, a neighbor brush hogged it last night.  Hopefully we got it cut before any went to seed.I have included a few pictures of some of the plants growing in the woods and open areas.  The 3 pictures that start with the label vine are of the vine that likes to grow in trees, eventually taking over the canopy.  One is of a new vine starting and the other two of much older vines.  The 2 pictures are of a vine type plant that has overtaken a small hill we use for sledding.  This can take over an area rather quickly also.  I'm not sure what this plant is called and is it invasive.  I have also attached a picture of what I believe is called Reed Grass.  I'm not sure if this is invasive and if so, how one controls it.  The last picture shows what the knapweed looked like in the 2 acre field just before cutting it.As of now, I'm hoping to hit the clover food p]lot area with glyphosate by the end of the weekend.  Targeting to have the clover area replanted by late August/early September.Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions and helping me out.ScottOn Wed, Jun 7, 2023 at 10:53 AM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: Scott,  With regard to pokeweed, it is not classified as invasive...but even native plants can be aggressive and problematic for human activity. Invasive species are introduced species classified by some governing body (e.g. State of Michigan). They are given this designation when they are causing harm to the native species or the environment in some way or they are a threat to human health or the economy.   I'm glad to hear the knapweed was brush hogged. You definitely will reduce seed production this way. I have seed knapweed flowering below mowing height though, so it won't likely take care of all of it, particularly if it is behaving as a short lived perennial.   I think two of the three vine photos you sent look like poison ivy. I think the dangling vine photo looks like a wild grape species. They usually have shaggy bark like that. I shared these with my colleague here, Angie Tenney, and she agrees. Both poison ivy and the grape species found in Michigan are also native.  I think your plan to renovate the clover field with glyphosate will be a good start. Since it has been dry and the plants are flowering, they maybe under stress and you may not get a good of control as if you wait until you see new green growth to treat. New growth indicates that the processes in the plant are fully functioning and a systemic herbicide like glyphosate will move throughout the plant better.\nUser: Hi, Riley, In checking out the link from your prior email listing the plants considered invasive, I see I can add the Autumn Olive to the list of invasive species on the property.  Apparently Autumn Olive is very difficult to kill.  I must admit though that their berries taste pretty good and the deer like them too.  The wild grape seem to just take over a tree and kill it. We've cut vines that were close to 3 inches in diameter.  I noticed over the weekend that some knapweed has started to grow in our yard and the neighbor's yard.  Hopefully we can stop it from spreading further.  How long can knapweed live without flowering?Interesting point about when to apply the glyphosate.  I was thinking now would be the time when they are under duress.  We'll need a little more rain than what we received on Sunday before applying the glyphosate.Thank you for your time and answering my questions.ScottOn Fri, Jun 9, 2023 at 2:38 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: Spotted knapweed is considered a biennial to a short-lived perennial in Michigan, so it shouldn't live more than 2 or 3ish years....but more plants may come up from seed if it has flowered in the past.   I'm always happy to help as best I can :)\nUser: Hi, Riley, I was out looking at the remnants of my \"clover\" plot or should I say \"knapweed\" plot and am wondering if knapweed is drought resistant.  It looks like the knapweed seems to be growing quite well since it was cut a couple of weeks ago. You had suggested waiting on applying the glyphosate until we have received some rain.  The extended forecast indicates the chance for rain is not until Monday or Tuesday of next week so, should I apply the glyphosate now before the knapweed gets much bigger?On another note, I have 8 chestnut trees that I have planted over the last 4 years.  Let me clarify that.  I have purchased and planted 14 chestnut trees since April 2009 and have 8 that have made it this far.  I have  2 Colossal Chestnut (Castanea sativa x crenata), 2 - Precoce Migoule Chestnut (Castanea sativa x crenata), and 4 - Chinese Chestnut (Castanea mollissima).

Do you have any thoughts on what is eating the leaves and how would I control it? Both of these trees look like they will blossom for the first time this year.

It would seem from a research paper I was just looking over (Mraz et al 2014) that the level of drought tolerance in spotted knapweed is controlled by genetics, with some populations being more drought tolerant than others (i.e. in this European study the tetraploid plants were more tolerant than the diploids).   If the spotted knapweed is actively growing (getting taller, producing more leaves), then this is an ok time to spray. The risk is that these plants are moisture stress and they may therefore not absorb and translocate (move within the plant) the herbicide as well as they would when not under stress. You'll likely get some activity...but maybe not as great.   For your chestnut question I would recommend submitting a separate Ask Extension question with photos.

Cutting and removing the plants before the pods open can help manage its spread. For autumn olive, mechanical removal combined with herbicide application on cut stumps can be effective. Regular monitoring and early intervention are key to managing these species.

About a week ago, we began to notice large missing areas on previously healthy leaves and drying tips (that appear black) on other previously healthy leaves.  \n\nPrior to this tree being planted here, we removed a very old lilac bush that was dying back.  It was very large and old back in 1998 when we moved here.  We took good care of it, and it bloomed beautifully until about a year or so ago when parts of it began to die back (starting with multiple black spots on its leaves).  We would cut off the dead branches, but it eventually entirely died.  When we removed it, we also removed all of its remaining very woody roots.\n\nPlease help us save our little tree!  My guess is that more than one problem is occurring here.  The \"holes\" in the leaves clearly seem to indicate some sort of hungry pest, while I'm not sure about the black tips. I have more photos available beyond what I've uploaded here, if that would help.  (This site only allowed me to upload three photos.)"

Last year two began to experience die back (withering leaves, leaves covered with a black substance, stems dying). I sprayed them with a 3-in-1 product to fight disease and insects.  This year a third Holly is experiencing the same problem, and the original two have not fully recovered.  \n\n1. Is there anything I can do to save these plants?\n2. How to I prevent the spread of these problems to the other shrubs?\nExpert: Hi, Jordan, Thank you for your question and pictures of your holly shrubs. After some research it may be that your holly has phytophthora root rot, a water mold fungi. Usually yellowing of the leaves, early leaf drop, slowed plant growth, and twig dieback are seen at early stages of the disease. Your pictures, especially the second one, appear to match this description. As the disease progresses limbs dieback to the main trunk and you may notice a black streak from the limb back towards the roots.  Some of the conditions that allow this fungi to flourish include planting in a poorly draining or wet spot, too deep planting depth, or over-mulching of the plants. This summer, with its heat, drought and now recent heavy rains, is probably further stressing your holly.  Actions you can take to prevent disease spread to the remaining shrubs include making sure they weren't planted too deeply to start. Attached is a good image of correct planting and correct mulching where the mulch is not packing up to the base of the shrub.  Treating with fungicides is successful as a preventative measure so unfortunately the two hollies that have a lot of die back are not likely to grow back. After removal, it is recommended to fumigate and aerate the soil before placing another woody shrub in its place. I have also attached links to other extension articles describing typical diseases affecting holly for your information. I'm sorry I don't have better news for you but hope this helps you save the other Hollys in your yard.

Is it enough to pull and remove from the greenhouse or is something additional needed to prevent further infestation of the next plants? Another place in building are squash vines with much mildew on leaves. Again, is removal from building enough to prevent infection of the next crop? I can provide more pictures if needed. Computer being unhelpful tonight.\nExpert: Hello, I have a couple of questions for you. Is this your own personal greenhouse or is it a commercial greenhouse? I want to make sure you're on the right site. Also, could you send a few pictures that are closer to the black spots on the leaves and also on the top leaf that looks like it has white bumps on it? They could be holes in the leaf, but I can't be sure. I can't focus the picture to get a clear idea of what the black spots are. They may be insects.  If you could send close-up photos of the two areas in question, I might be able to get a clearer idea of the problem.  As to the mildew problem: there are two common types of mildew found on plants, powdery mildew and downy mildew and powdery mildew. Could you also send a photo of that plant?  Thank you and I'll wait for your response.\nUser: The greenhouse is part of a city-wide project. It is 20 x 30 I'm guessing.

For the insect problem, it's important to first identify the type of insect to determine the best course of action. Since you mentioned that the insects have spread to okra plants, it would be wise to remove heavily infested plants to prevent further spread. Additionally, consider using insecticidal soap or neem oil, which are effective against many common greenhouse pests. Ensure good air circulation and monitor the plants regularly for any signs of new infestations.\\n\\nRegarding the mildew on squash vines, it's crucial to identify whether it's powdery or downy mildew, as the treatments can differ. Generally, improving air circulation, reducing humidity, and removing affected leaves can help manage mildew. Fungicidal treatments may also be necessary, especially if the mildew is widespread. Regularly inspect your plants and maintain good cultural practices to prevent future outbreaks.\\n\\nIf you have any further questions or need more specific advice, feel free to reach out with additional details or images.\"}"

There are home spray products that have more specific and effective control than the general product you have been using. Just as important is timing your sprays effectively. You can use a tool like Enviroweather https://enviroweather.msu.edu/ to monitor conditions for specific pests and disease in your area based on weather conditions in addition to following the articles published in-season by our extension staff (for you the Northwest MI reports will be best) https://www.canr.msu.edu/fruit/  If you haven't done a soil test recently you should have one done, which would come with recommendations for fertilization. https://homesoiltest.msu.edu/get-started  Your practice of keeping the orchard free from diseased fruit is one you should continue.\nUser: What is causing the damage to my honeycrisp apples?

Is this true?\nMy mature Autumn Flame and October Glory Sugar maple leaves have extensive black spot. The canopy is now fairly shaded although the top of the trees are in the sun.I have attached a photo. The spots are more black than brown, and started to appear in late spring. Pretty much all of the leaves are affected. Please identify!\nA volunteer oak has extensive damage to its leaves: brown spots surrounded by lighter green, covering the entire tree. I have many other oaks on the property that do not have similar damage. I have attached two photos. Is this something I have to be concerned about?\nExpert: It appears that your oak leaves are being attacked by oak lace bugs.  During the weeks of summer, the symptoms caused by oak lace bugs can be a concern to some landscapers & nurserymen. Often, the infestations are most pronounced on white oaks. From a distance, the stippling of leaves from this piecing-sucking insect can produce symptoms that are like those from oak spider mites or classic leaf scorch. Closer inspection determines the identity of the pest. Be certain to examine leaf undersides.   With an additional generation or two, by late August the leaf feeding  symptoms can be more severe. (Photo Credit: Steven K. Rettke, Rutgers  Coop. Ext.)   With only the 1st generation active in early July, the feeding symptoms by  the oak lace bugs are still mild. (Photo Credit: Steven K. Rettke,  Rutgers Coop. Ext.)Although the leaf discoloration of the foliage caused by oak lace bugs can be alarming, spraying is generally not considered to be necessary. Tall landscape oaks would require large spray volumes of insecticides to achieve controls.This pest primarily creates an aesthetic concern. It is doubtful the insects have significantly reduced the tree’s ability to store starches & sugars during much of the summer. Infested trees are often able to perform adequate photosynthesis before symptoms become severe. The plant health damage to large oaks in the landscape is usually minimal.\nExpert: My apologies...I sent my response before finishing.  If you find no insects, your tree is probably infected with a fungal leaf spot disease. Most leaf spot diseases are very host-specific, meaning they will only affect one type of plant or a related plant family. Generally, a disease is not going to move from an oak tree to a maple tree or any other unrelated trees.   Fungicide applications are not necessary because the leaf spots are rarely severe and the leaves can still function. Although infections may be extensive in some years, little damage actually results. This is one of those plant diseases that appears worse than it actually is. Fungicide applications won’t cure the disease once the spots have formed on the leaves.   Also, from a practical standpoint, fungicides are difficult to apply to large trees. For small trees, fungicides containing mancozeb or  chlorothalonil can be applied to prevent spotting, but must be applied prior to and during bud break, when dormant buds open and shoots begin to grow, in early spring. Once bud break has occurred and symptoms are visible, it’s too late to spray.   Leaf spot diseases will not kill a tree that is otherwise healthy. If a tree dies during the summer, it’s more likely because of drought stress, root damage or other issues not related to a leaf spot disease. Keep trees healthy by providing supplemental water during extreme drought conditions, adding mulch to the root zone to conserve water and avoiding mechanical equipment injuries to the roots or trunks.\nUser: Thank you, this is very helpful!Valerie On Thu, Jun 29, 2023 at 12:56 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nUser: Thanks so much for your thorough reply.

First, the browning tips could be a sign of stress or rot, possibly due to water quality or the cuttings being submerged too deeply. Ensure that only the nodes (where the leaves were attached) are submerged in water, and change the water regularly to keep it fresh. You can also try using distilled or rainwater if your tap water is high in chlorine or other chemicals. \\n\\nRegarding the use of rooting hormone, while it's not absolutely necessary, it can help speed up the rooting process and improve success rates, especially if you're moving the cuttings to soil. If you decide to plant them in soil, make sure to use a well-draining potting mix and keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. \\n\\nTo prevent future issues with root rot, ensure good air circulation around the cuttings and avoid overwatering. If other plants are thriving in water, it might be worth experimenting with different water propagation techniques or even trying a semi-hydroponic setup. \\n\\nI hope this helps, and feel free to reach out if you have more questions!\"}"

Look for products containing active ingredients like 2,4-D, MCPP, or Dicamba, which are often effective against many broadleaf weeds but should be used with caution to avoid harming desirable plants. Always follow the label instructions carefully. After you have managed the weeds, the best time to seed with a pollinator mix is typically in the early fall or early spring when temperatures are cooler and there's more moisture, which helps seeds establish. You can find pollinator seed mixes at garden centers, online retailers, or local agricultural supply stores.

Do you know what might be happening and what we can do about this? Also, do you know what kind of tree this is? We aren't sure\nExpert: Hello, Dakota and thanks for the question.  It's hard to tell from these photos what type of tree or what type of insect might be nibbling on the leaves. From what I can see in the photos, it's possible it could be some type of poplar or perhaps a cottonwood. Please send back some photos that show a close up of an uncurled leaf, one that shows a full branch with clarity of several leaves and the branch, one of the full tree and a further-away photo showing the tree's surroundings. Please ensure the photos are clear and not backlit (e.g., please photograph it with your back to the sun.) From that, we should be easily able to tell what tree it is and get more information about a potential pest problem.  Two more notes:  1) Re: branches not sprouting leaves: I can say that, with this very cool and wet spring, many trees have been very late to leaf out. from the photos, it appears that the tree does have sufficient foliage to photosynthesize to produce it's food, so hopefully it's not a big issue, but it's potentially too early to tell. Our current recommendation is to give it a 2-3 more weeks to see how it does and if it's not recovering, please write back with more photos and any symptoms you see.   2) Insects Attacking: Again, with this moist, cool spring producing fewer leaves for our insects to eat or use for nesting material, many of our beneficial insects and those we don't think of so fondly have less to share this spring, so I'm noticing a few more holes in my garden leaves this spring. The leaf damage you've shown in the close up looks minimal to me, and to my gardener's eyes, I wouldn't call it damage (again, just from that one photo.)   A good rule of thumb is that if there are only a few small similarly-shaped holes, it's likely that it's leaf-cutter bee or other native beneficial pollinators behaving normally without damaging the tree. However, if you're seeing significant damage that you worry will harm the tree or that adversely impacts overall appearance of the tree to an unacceptable level, we will be able to see that and provide advice based on the photos I requested above.   I hope this helps.  Best regards, Joanne, Boulder Counter Master Gardener Volunteer\nUser: Hello,Thanks for your quick response. I really appreciate it. I want sure if there was anyone that monitored this service.  There definitely does seem to be a lot of leaf damage. Many of the leaves have multiple holes.  Also, many if the branches are brittle and seem dead. Let me know if these photos work.

The way to best deal with that is to readjust what you think of as typical 'lawn', and plant salt-tolerant species which can survive periodic inundation, which will surely happen again. These species of grass (or grass-like rushes) have some salt tolerance. Most will require full sun to thrive, and salt levels aside, some will also need better drainage than others. Those with the best salt tolerance (moderate **, high ***) are noted. Broomsedge (Andropogon virginicus)**Soft Rush (Juncus effusus)**Black Needlerush (Juncus roemerianus)***Wool Rush (Scirpus cyperinus)Smooth Cordgrass (Spartina alternifolia)***Saltmeadow Hay (Spartina patens)***Big Cordgrass (Spartina cynosuroides)***Giant Bulrush (Schoenoplectus validus)**Saltmarsh Rush (Juncus gerardii)***Bitter Beachgrass/Panicgrass (Panicum amarum)***Dunegrass (Ammophila brevilgulata)***Bushy Bluestem (Andropogon glomeratus)**Seashore Saltgrass (Distichlis spicata)***Canada Rush (Juncus canadensis) Most are not 'typical' turf grass lawn, but can be beautiful. We are always suggesting that people re-imagine how much turf lawn they really need, as it is sterile to wildlife and pollinators, is non-native and takes a remarkable amount of time, effort, cost and chemical applications to thrive.  To this end, you could take a look at this page from our website: https://extension.umd.edu/resource/lawn-alternatives/. There are many salt-tolerant shrubs that are native to Maryland like Itea, Button Bush, American Hollies, Sweet Bay Magnolia and others that would be attractive and be able to take the occasional flooding without issue.    Christine\nUser: Thanks so much for responding. To that end I assume there is no grass like fescue, bermuda, etc that forms like a conventional lawn that would work??  Thanks again BillOn Mon, Oct 28, 2024 at 10:47 AM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

        "value": "User: We have a large wooded yard. In the past 2 years we have noted --in different areas of a nearly one-acre yard--groups of shrubs or trees that are completely dead after being vigorous for nearly 50 years. Even a large grove of bamboo has mysteriously died. We have never discouraged any bamboo disappearing, but it has been our experience that it is virtually indestructible. We have always maintained a completely organic approach to yard care and we have lived here for more than 35 years.  We would like to have the soil tested in the various areas where the damage has occurred.\nPlease advise how we can proceed.  Thank-you\nExpert: We can share information about basic soil testing (see linked page), but it only screens for nutrient content (not all nutrients, just most of the major elements), acidity level (pH), organic matter content, and when certain labs offer it, heavy metal levels. Unfortunately, while that information would still have value (especially if the pH were to be wildly out of the normal range), it probably won't help diagnose a problem affecting so many different species. A standard soil test can't screen for pathogens, pests, or herbicide residues. An environmental testing lab could test for chemical residues, but they would need to know exactly what compounds to look for, as they cannot test for the large number of chemicals and additives used in various pesticides (even organic pesticides). If there hasn't been a chemical spill, suspected misapplied pesticides (mainly herbicides, given the dieback issues), then a toxin is not likely the cause.  Did anything flood the property (or areas of dieback) prior to the plant losses? As resilient and invasive as running bamboo can be, for example, it still has its limits, and too little soil oxygen from oversaturated conditions may kill it, and can definitely kill other, more sensitive species. Was there any digging in the root zones prior to dieback, such as from construction, regrading, or utility work?  Trees die for a variety of reasons, including root loss, stress and secondary pest/disease issues, physical damage, girding roots, and so forth. It's not uncommon for decline and dieback to begin weeks, months, or even years before symptoms become prominent, making it hard to trace back the original cause. Even if different species die around the same time, they won't necessarily share a common cause.  A certified arborist or licensed tree expert can help evaluate struggling trees to narrow-down a diagnosis and look for sources of tree stress that might be able to be alleviated, either for that specimen or, if it's unsalvageable, for a replacement tree. If it's too late for the current trees (little can be determined if they are already fully dead or decline is advanced), you can try that approach if this keeps occurring in the future.  If you'd like us to make some educated guesses as to contributing factors, we would need to know what plants have been lost, what seasons they declined in (or at least when it was noticed as being prominent), and what symptoms manifested. For example, we've seen numerous examples lately of dead or dying 'Green Giant' arborvitae around central Maryland landscapes that succumbed to this year's prolonged drought. (Which in most of the state, has still not abated; see linked map.) The drought of this year, combined with last year's drought, and even the excessive rains of 2018 (and to a lesser extent, 2019) have all been stressing even mature, well-established plants.  Some species have a greater tolerance for wet soil (such as Pin Oak) while others have a greater tolerance for dry soil (such as Bur Oak), so each will be stressed or suffer root loss under different circumstances. Unfortunately, in recent years, we've experienced both extremes of precipitation at different times, and while winters have been mild overall, summer heat waves are also taxing some species. Those who lost lots of roots to soil saturation one year might be more easily damaged by drought a few years later, since the root system may not have recovered fully yet and can't keep up with the moisture demands of the canopy. Some pathogens, like Volutella Blight in boxwoods and Botryosphaeria and Hypoxylon cankers in many shrubs and trees, can become infectious and damaging when their host plants are under stress, when before they lived harmlessly alongside the same plant. Similarly, some wood-boring insects preferentially attack plants stressed by either too much or too little soil moisture.  We're happy to help puzzle-out what might be going on, but unless it's one event that impacted such a wide area, each plant might have to be assessed on a species-by-species basis, since their vulnerabilities to different environmental stress factors or pests/diseases won't always overlap. We can also provide feedback on the results of a soil test if you opt to do one.  Miri\nUser: Miri, thanks for your prompt response. ( remain doubtful that these isolated were a result of an  which were source. There is a stand of 5 large philadelphus shrubs which were in full bloom and thriving in May of this year.. They have been in existence here since the mid-fifties, I was told. We bought our residence in 19 84 and they were quite large then . Now they are completely dead….dry thruout.   There is another stand of the mock orange some 12 feet away and they are completely fine. Both in the same environment : on a small slope under a large maple tree. There is no wash-out path near either of them that would be observed during harsh rainstorms.   There are 2 smoke trees….some 10 years old… ,located about 50 feet away which are dead.   There are winterberries in another part of the yard (irrigated) which appear to be close to death. We are most puzzled by the bamboo as that was planted in the early 50’s we were told and have been very aggressive during our time here. We just tried to control them by hacking away every year. Meanwhile, this year there is a section of bamboo (which pretty much is a virtual barricade around 3/4 of our property) measuring about 50 ft in width that is rainbrowned out and dead.  In my opinion, the damage we’ve seen cannot be attributed to heat, rain or any other natural cause..I would like to get some assurance that  there is no toxic element involved, as we have pets and small children who play in the yard.Are you saying there would be no way to get a soil analysis without having an idea as to what the source might be?  That would be very frustrating.On Nov 5, 2024, at 12:25 PM, Ask Extension wrote:"

You can still use row covers to protect the plants from future pest infestations. As for edibility, as long as the damage is not extensive and the inner parts of the cabbage are healthy, they should still be edible. Just remove the damaged outer leaves before consuming.

These borers attack a number of different perennials, including lilies, hollyhocks and asters. The gray-brown, one-inch-long adult moth lays eggs in fall on plant debris around the garden and on weeds such as ragweed, thistle and burdock. The eggs hatch in spring and the inch-long, brown larvae bore into stalks of newly emerging perennials. The larvae tunnel and feed on the stem pith and emerge in midsummer, leaving another hole in the stalk. They then feed on other stems or pupate in the soil. The flower bud above the feeding area usually dies, but the plant remains alive.  Certain borer larvae will continue eating until the bulb is consumed, endangering the entire plant.      To control, cut off and destroy any flower stalks as soon as you see the damage.   Then, in fall, cut off and destroy all the old foliage from lilies to lessen the problem next year.  To make a positive identification cut the stem in half and try to get a picture of the offending insect.       It is possible that another insect is utilizing the hole for nesting.  Again, the stem would need to be cut to identify the opportunistic interloper.      I hope that you find this information useful and as always Happy Gardening.\nUser: Hopefully this will help identify the insect.  I was originally reluctant to destroy the plant in case they were helpful bees.  Any ideas?"

To answer your question, I spoke with an entomologist who said this is definitely a roach, but it may be a wood roach,  not a cockroach. If you want to submit a sample to positively identify this roach, please contact Ann Hazelrigg at <personal data hidden>  It wouldn’t be unusual to find a wood roach in the garage, especially if the structure is located in a wooded area or if you  store firewood in the garage.  Here are a few websites that might help you identify the roach:  https://hortnews.extension.iastate.edu/wood-cockroach  https://www.pubs.ext.vt.edu/content/pubs_ext_vt_edu/en/ENTO/ENTO-426/ENTO-426.html  https://extension.psu.edu/wood-cockroaches One simple distinction between cockroaches and wood roaches is that wood roaches move more slowly and don't skitter away to avoid humans. If you only find one or two of these insects, it is likely they are wood roaches. The easiest way to manage them is through exclusion, which means to seal off entrances to your home or garage.\nUser: ﻿\nHi, Elliot, (and Ann)\nThank you for your quick response.\nThe below quote from your response is what has me worried.\n“They skitter .”\nAs soon as the direct sun is off our siding (about 5 to 6 pm) about 4 or 5 will begin to appear.  As I approach one it will immediately dart ﻿to find a gap in the clapboard. If it can’t find a place to hide (or I try to swat it) it will usually drop to the ground and be lost to me .\nI have probably seen 50 or 60 in the last week, on siding, on screens, and in between the screen and window glass.  About 10 have made it into the house, found either high on a wall, three on the kitchen counter and one hiding under the  ill-fitting strainer in the bathroom sink.\nThe first cockroach was on the kitchen counter. I caught it and put it out the back door.  I noticed it hung around the door threshold all day. (It wasn’t injured.) That behavior made me wonder.\nInaturalist’s AI suggested it was either a tawny or dusky cockroach.  (Admittedly the picture wasn’t very good.)\nIn my opinion, they are definitely trying to get in the house and they definitely are very evasive when spotted.\nAppearance-wise, they could be male wood cockroaches, but the behavior seems quite different than one would expect with wood cockroaches.\nLinda\n\n> On Jun 22, 2023, at 11:28 AM, Extension Foundation <ask> wrote:\n> One simple distinction between cockroaches and wood roaches is that wood roaches move more slowly and don't skitter away to avoid humans.</ask>"

Watermelon plants prefer consistent moisture, but they do not like to be waterlogged. The initial heavy rains followed by a period of heat and increased watering could have caused the roots to become stressed. Here are a few steps you can take:\\n\\n1. **Check Soil Moisture:** Ensure that the soil is consistently moist but not soggy. You can use a moisture meter or simply check by sticking your finger into the soil about an inch deep. If it feels dry, it's time to water.\\n\\n2. **Mulch:** Apply a layer of mulch around the base of the plant to help retain soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.\\n\\n3. **Watering Schedule:** Water deeply but less frequently to encourage deep root growth. Early morning is the best time to water to reduce evaporation and fungal diseases.\\n\\n4. **Inspect for Pests:** Check the undersides of the leaves for any signs of pests like aphids or spider mites, which can also cause leaf curling.\\n\\n5. **Nutrient Deficiency:** Consider if there might be a nutrient deficiency. A balanced fertilizer might help if the plant is lacking essential nutrients.\\n\\nIf the problem persists, you might want to consult with a local extension service for more specific advice tailored to your area's conditions.\"}"

I understand I'll probably have to spray for 3-4 years until all the seeds are spent.  Question:  when I spray this year, does it make sense to let it grow tall and then spray it?  Of course I would spray before it goes to seed.  That way, it will protect the native plants beneath it.

It is generally recommended to spray stiltgrass when it is young and actively growing, typically in the spring, before it has a chance to flower and set seed. This approach minimizes the risk of seed production and further spread. However, if you have observed that spraying later in the season helps protect native plants, you might consider a balanced approach: monitor the growth closely and spray before it reaches the flowering stage, ensuring you still protect the native plants as much as possible. Additionally, consider integrating other control methods, such as manual removal or planting competitive native species, to help manage the stiltgrass population over time.\"}"

For a low maintenance large shrub to replace the ninebark on the SW side of your house, consider options like the 'Limelight' Hydrangea, which is known for its hardiness and beautiful blooms, or the 'Viburnum' which offers attractive foliage and flowers. Both are relatively low maintenance and can thrive in various conditions.\\n\\n2. While it's not typical to put mulch directly on top of landscaping rock, it can be done if you are looking to improve aesthetics or add a layer of weed control. However, be aware that the mulch may not stay in place as well as it would on soil, and it could eventually mix with the rock, making it harder to separate later.\\n\\n3. For planting ground cover in the rock on the west side, consider using hardy, drought-tolerant plants like 'Creeping Thyme' or 'Sedum'. These can often be planted by creating small pockets in the rock, adding some soil, and then planting the ground cover. Seeds can be sprinkled, but for better establishment, planting small plants or plugs is recommended.\\n\\n4. Under the porch on the east side, you might try 'Ajuga' or 'Liriope', which are both shade-tolerant and can help suppress weeds. Again, planting in small soil pockets within the rock will give the best results. Additionally, consider using landscape fabric under the rock to further prevent weed growth.\"}"

Here are some steps you can take:\\n\\n1. **Soil Testing**: Conduct a soil test to identify the specific type of fungus and any other soil health issues. This will help in selecting the appropriate treatment.\\n\\n2. **Fungicide Treatment**: Based on the soil test results, apply a suitable fungicide to treat the soil. Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.\\n\\n3. **Soil Preparation**: Remove the dead sod and any debris. Consider tilling the soil to improve aeration and drainage, which can help prevent future fungal growth.\\n\\n4. **Amend the Soil**: Add organic matter or compost to improve soil health and structure. This can also help in suppressing fungal growth.\\n\\n5. **Select Resistant Sod**: When choosing new sod, look for varieties that are resistant to the specific fungus identified in your soil test.\\n\\n6. **Professional Help**: If you're unsure about any of these steps, consider hiring a professional lawn care service that specializes in fungal issues.\\n\\nBy taking these steps, you can create a healthier environment for your new sod and reduce the risk of fungal contamination.\"}"

Consider a health check if the behavior persists.\\n\\n5. **Reintegration:** If the isolated hen is removed for her safety, reintroduce her slowly to the flock, ideally during free-ranging when the hens are more distracted.\\n\\nThese steps can help manage the situation and protect the isolated hen.

It has already flowered so there are no pictures of that but i do know it flowers purple every year. It can grow it be pretty tall, at least 10 feet, and seems to grow in a clump like formation.

After looking at the 2 links you sent, the leaves on the plants in my yard do look about identical to the Eastern Redbud leaves. The only issue is that all these redbud pictures are of trees with a single trunk.

I recommend you hire a certified arborist if we can’t figure this out together. To try this, I need a closer photo of a branch showing the place where it goes from alive to dead, if possible. A couple of distant views also. You need to illustrate the whole thing so we can see any pattern to the dead spots. How far back does the fully dead area reach? Dead is brittle and no green if you scratch the bark. Are these limbs dead clear to the trunk? Do you see lesions on the trunk bark? Then also, tell me everything you can think of about it. When did this start and how fast is it changing? What fertilizer or herbicides have been used in the area, and when. Describe summer irrigation. Has any construction or ditching been done? I hope we can get this, but it does become sort of a game of 20 questions.\nUser: Photos are attached.\nUser: More photos\nUser: Last 2 photos.\nUser: Hello,Thank you for your response.

Can you get a really close photo of it tomorrow? What do backs of leaves look like on the \"sick but not dead\" leaves? It almost looks like a scale insect. What happens if you scrape off the \"bumps\" on the bark? (Internet search \"scale insect\" and select images for a survey of how the different ones appear.) Another idea is that your plant is burned by something like hot exhaust from a car, truck, or maybe a gas powered hedge trimmer tool?\nUser: Thank you, Quinn.  I will take more pics tomorrow and answer the rest of your questions. And no, I don’t believe the hedge is burned.

As I look carefully this morning, I think your shrubs have a cottony bark scale infestation. I’ll share a zoomed in portion of your photo. Compare it to images on this Azalea bark scale information page from OSU. The name is “Azalea”, but they can live on other plants as well. Am I right? Scrape them off and look close. What to do? I’ll list resources for you because there are more steps than I can write up on this forum. Especially chemical control needs to be carefully timed and follow insecticide labels exactly. For right now, get the heavily infected dead and dying parts removed and off of your property rather than composting onsite. Do this right away because it’s time for eggs to hatch and the crawling stage to spread into new parts of your shrubs. The pages I’m sharing give instructions about applying sticky tape to catch crawlers. I don’t think you’ll trap all of them, but it is a good way to monitor when the critters are there. A 10x magnifier can help you see them. I’ve used the magnifier app on my phone sometimes. The “biological control” listed is other insects eating these, so don’t rush out with broad spectrum insecticide. Instead, follow the cultural controls listed first. Prune, scrape, water correctly but don’t fertilize. Don’t be dismayed and give up on the plants yet. English laurel can regrow even if you nearly cut it to the ground, which is called “rejuvenation pruning”. My mother’s Camellia shrub was covered with scale a few years ago. We pruned off what we could and watered it better to keep it strong. The scale is gone and the plant shape filled back in. Perhaps the plant defenses took over, or predatory insects cleaned it up. If you decide pesticides are necessary but you are unable to apply them correctly yourself, consider hiring a certified arborist company with licensing to do it for you. Okay, here’s those information pages to read before you actually do anything. PNW Handbook Azalea Bark Scale page. Landscape plants scale insects page of the PNW Handbook. Note the different control options. The PNW Handbook page for chemical control of landscape pests. (Oh, and I’m attaching the zoomed in version of your photo.)\nUser: This is great information and I will get busy on the steps you suggest. Crossing my fingers that we can save our beautiful old hedge! Thank you so much for your help.LynneOn Fri, May 10, 2024 at 7:42 AM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

Since the area is too large for you to handle alone, hiring a professional who specializes in eco-friendly weed removal might be a good option. They can use tools like weed wrenches or hoes to remove the plants effectively. Additionally, maintaining a healthy pasture by overseeding with competitive grasses can help suppress buffalo-bur growth in the future. Regular mowing before the plants set seed can also reduce their spread. Make sure to wear protective clothing when handling buffalo-bur, as it can cause skin irritation.\"}"

Since you've added a second brood box and another honey super, you're giving your bees plenty of space to expand, which is good for preventing swarming.

However, if you notice a lack of nectar sources or if the bees seem to be struggling, you might consider feeding them. \\n\\nAs for splitting the hive, you'll want to monitor the colony's population and behavior. If you see signs of overcrowding or preparations for swarming, such as queen cells, it might be time to split. Since you have an empty hive, you can use it for the split. \\n\\nRegarding the honey flow, it varies depending on your location and local flora. Typically, it occurs in spring and early summer when flowers are in full bloom. You can check with local beekeeping associations or observe the blooming patterns in your area to get a better idea of when the honey flow is happening. \\n\\nLastly, for the beetles, it's good that you're planning to treat them.

This occurred after pruning. The same thing happened last year  in different soil and in a different spot.\nExpert: Hello, Avery, It is interesting that the same thing happened last year after pruning. The leaf tissue appears to be desiccated. Desiccation can occur from chemicals, or wind or sun damage. It could also be related to insufficient or incomplete watering. Do you clean your pruners before you prune? What do you use? Typical sanitizing cleaners are 10% bleach solution or rubbing alcohol. These typically do not affect the plant tissue. As part of pruning, do you fertilize or apply herbicides at the same time? Fertilizers are compounds that can desiccate the plant tissue. Errant herbicide can burn the tissue as well. The area that shows the bleaching – was that previously protected from the sun until other foliage was removed by pruning? If that leaf surface was protected, then all of a sudden was in strong sunlight, it could become sun scalded. Wind and sun can desiccate leaf tissue rapidly. Are these tomatoes in containers? Containers with good drainage can make it difficult to maintain good and consistent soil moisture. Too little irrigation could lead to stunted, dehydrated new growth. Beyond the bleached tissue, there does appear to be some fungal disease on leaves.  If this condition results in severe damage to your tomato plants, you may want to send a tissue sample to the MSU Diagnostic Labs to get a definite assessment of the cause. Take a tissue sample of any discolored foliage and send it to the MSU Diagnostic Labs for identification. The following website describes the services and the fee structure for analysis performed by the Diagnostic Lab.: https://www.canr.msu.edu/pestid/ This website provides directions and tips for taking a good sample: https://www.canr.msu.edu/pestid/submit-samples/\nUser: Thank you very much.  Sent from my iPhone On Jul 14, 2024, at 9:15 PM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:   ﻿\nUser: I wondered about yellow tomato leaf curl virus, but there’s not much I can do about that now anyway. Sent from my iPhone On Jul 14, 2024, at 9:22 PM, Daniel Moshier <<personal data hidden>> wrote:   ﻿Thank you very much.  Sent from my iPhone On Jul 14, 2024, at 9:15 PM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:   ﻿"

They would be planted on the northwest side of the house.\nThank you, Skyler\nExpert: An alternative plant might be easier to grow and source. Canby's Mountain-lover, Paxistima canbyi, is barely native within Maryland, having only been documented growing wild in Alleghany County. Since it is considered endangered in Maryland, it's not recommended to grow it in a home setting unless you have the right habitat and the source of the plant was local (provenance, or the genetic source of the plants, should be as local as possible to avoid contaminating the gene pool of local populations with out-of-area adaptations that could harm them). We are not aware of any local native plant nurseries offering this species for sale, especially with local provenance, and it would be possible they'd need a permit to do so given the plant's status in our state. Technically, Maryland law may make it illegal to cultivate plants with rare, threatened, or endangered status, though it doesn't seem that that law is strictly enforced.  Overall, the species is rare throughout its limited range, being confined to the higher-elevation regions within the Appalachian Mountains. (In the linked map, counties highlighted in yellow are the native range, and the yellow color indicates a rare status.) In horticultural reference material, it's listed as growing in USDA zones 3-7, which puts it at the edge of heat tolerance for typical Maryland conditions. Missouri Botanical Garden notes that this species is vulnerable to a fungal leaf spot (by itself, not a red flag, as many plant species contract various leaf spot infections) and, more seriously, root rot. If soils are clay-heavy, compacted, or otherwise not very well drained, the plant may succumb to root loss in damp conditions. (Their recommendations are for growing in sandy-rocky soils, as would be typical of most mountainous habitats.) Foundation plants often need to contend with compacted soil given the proximity to the house and compaction caused by home construction.  Miri\nUser: Thank you for the information!

Is this a fungus which could be controlled or should be tossed, or is it genetic so no hope to irridicate?  Thanks.\nExpert: We're not certain what the cause of damage is, but suspect growing conditions instead of issues of pest or disease outbreaks. Have any chilly drafts hit the plants, and does the growing area get good air circulation? (Are the plants misted, or only watered in the \"tank\"/cup of the plant? Misting foliage might allow for easier infection by pathogens until the leaf surface dries.) Has any spray (pesticide or otherwise) been used on or near the plants before this damage appeared? Were any updates to grow lights made, where the light intensity output has increased? (Or are the plants in a greenhouse?)  We don't have extensive bromeliad experience as they are not as commonly grown here, so we may need to reach out to other Extension resources or experienced tropical plant experts outside of Maryland to see if they recognize the cause. (In that case, we can also share with them the information you provide us regarding the questions above, and hope to have some feedback during next week.)  Miri\nUser: Really appreciate your effort.  I was hoping it is a common issue for the genus that someone would recognize.  I should have mentioned that it is not on every leaf of a plant (usually 20-33%), it is mainly visible on top side, and it is in the tissue not raised.  Let's eliminate some issues by responding to your questions.1. This variety is in one room facing east on shelves 12-18\" from double pane windows, with reasonable space and no artificial light. 2. There is water in cup and I water the loose mix soil once or twice a week.  I mist irregulariy but never when there is sun (in morning).3.

Given the light conditions and watering practices, it's possible that the splotches could be a result of environmental stress, such as light intensity or water quality, although you have taken steps to mitigate these factors. Since the issue is not present on every leaf and is not raised, it might also be a genetic trait of the specific bromeliad varieties you are growing. If the plants are otherwise healthy and growing well, it may not be a cause for concern. However, if you notice any changes in the condition or health of the plants, it might be worth consulting with a local expert or bromeliad society for further insights.

It sounds like you've taken some great steps to prepare your maple tree for the colder weather. Planting a maple tree just before temperatures drop can be challenging, but not impossible.

The falling leaves are likely a natural response to the stress of transplanting and the changing season, so don't worry too much about that. Just make sure the tree is well-watered until the ground freezes, and avoid fertilizing until spring. With these precautions, your tree should have a good chance of surviving the winter.

Soil life, like worms and insects, also move organic matter from the soil surface down into deeper layers, and perhaps you happen to have enough soil life below the pile (especially since it's insulating the ground below it, like a mulch) that they are essentially tilling it into the ground for you.

Ensure you cover all parts of the plant thoroughly. As for pruning, thinning out the shrub can indeed help improve air circulation and light penetration, which can reduce the conditions that favor mildew growth. However, cutting it back drastically might stress the plant further. Instead, consider selectively pruning to open up the canopy. Since you've noted that the plants are too close together, try to maintain good spacing in the future to prevent similar issues. Keep an eye on your other plants and treat them as a precaution if you notice any signs of mildew.

(This side of the tree get a strong dose of sun. The opposite side of the tree looks healthy.) Last month the tree had beautiful blossoms and the leaves were all green. I did give the tree adequate water last autumn and this spring. I am at a loss as to what is happening and what I can do to help the tree. This tree was planted in our yard in 2018 & has been growing well since. \n\nThank you for your input!\nExpert: Good morning Jeanine and thank you for reaching out to ask2.extension. Don’t quit watering.  Thing's are really stressed due to the lack of rain.  my tree the leaves droop so bad.   I have a sprinkler that I can make sprinkle in a round circle.  I place it under one side of my tree and let it go for about 40 minutes and repeat on the other side.  The roots that take in moisture extend out to the canopy, so you need to get the whole area.  I do this about once a week.  If you get a good rain you can skip a week. You may have to do this until it freezes.  It’s been a tough summer. Also maybe check to be sure there’s no insect on the leaves or on the branches that you can see.  It still sounds like heat stress to me. I hope this helps.  Good luck!\nExpert: Jeanine it’s Deb Kroon again.  Can you send me a picture of your tree and  try to get a good pic of the leaves.  I want to be sure it’s not a disease.  I’ve done some more reading and want to check out that possibility too.  Thanks!\nUser: Dear, Avery,Thank you for your quick helpful reply!

Usually when scale is recognized on a plant, it is at a rather progressed stage unfotunatley.  There is a scale that is typical of Rhododendron and Azlaea plants, however this appears to be maybe the Cottony Camelia Scale or the Cottony Maple Scale (see photo further down on the Introduction to scale insects page).  You may want to consider removing the plants at this stage since it does appear that they have lost a lot of leaves as well. You can also explore some management options on the Introduction to scale insects page, however any chemical controls at this point may not have much immediate effect and with other potentially harmful impacts, removal may be easier at this point.  Azaleas that are planted near brick walls or house foundations tend to not be in their ideal environments. Often the soil conditions are not acidic enough for them plus if they are in more sun then they like, it can cause stress to the plants from the sun exposure and residual heat off of the brick surface during hot summer months.  If you would like suggestions or guidance on different plants to replace them with, please feel free to attach photos of the entire area and guide us on the general site conditions: sun exposure (which direction that side of the home faces: North South East West etc,) deer presence, soil condition - wet/dry/ presence of a nearby down spout, etc. You may want to get a laboratory soil test done for future plants or if you haven't done one before/ in awhile. It can tell you any lacking nutrients and the acidity (pH) level of the soil needed for certain plants.  Please reach out with further questions.  Emily\nUser: Thank u for the reply.

I bought two different kinds of blueberry bushes and planted them last fall: one was a vaccinium sunshine blue and the other was a chandler blueberry. The one on the right did not produce any berries, and looks really sad. Should I do something to the soil or do I need to add a specific kind of plant? The grapes were here when we moved in 3 years ago, and while leaves grow every year, they only produce a handful of small hard grapes and the leaves look like they are eaten by some kind of pest. Is this salvageable or should I plant something new? This garden gets afternoon sun. Thank you for any guidance!\nUser: Hello, one more question. I inherited this asparagus patch when I moved in three years ago. It had probably been established for 3-5 years before that. The first year we had a spring harvest that was pretty decent (and you can see how healthy the stalks were about this time last summer when I had to remove all these mushrooms growing underneath. I did not get much of a harvest this past spring, and the brown stalks are what the asparagus patch looks like now. Is there anything I can do for it at this stage to help have a better crop next spring? If some has died, can I add new asparagus to it at this stage or any companion crop that will help it grow better? Thanks\nExpert: Where are you in Orange County?  i recommend you schedule a home visit.  Blueberries require acid soil.

Since your tree's base is already mounded to the height of the wall, you should be cautious about adding more soil. Instead of filling the entire area with black dirt, consider using a combination of materials. You could use a lighter, more aerated material like coarse mulch or a mix of soil and organic matter that allows for better air circulation. Additionally, ensure that the fill slopes away from the tree to prevent water from pooling around the trunk, which can also be detrimental.

I'm glad to assist you with setting up a compost system that suits your needs.\\n\\n1. **Location Near Chicken Coop**: Placing the compost near the chicken coop can be convenient for managing waste, but it does come with the risk of attracting wildlife, including bears. To mitigate this, ensure the compost is well-contained and consider using bear-resistant designs.\\n\\n2. **Deterring Bears and Other Animals**: To deter bears, you can use a bear-proof compost bin or enclosure. These are designed to be sturdy and secure, preventing bears from accessing the contents. Additionally, avoid adding meat, dairy, or any strong-smelling food scraps that might attract wildlife.\\n\\n3. **Design and Materials**: Given the Vermont weather, consider using durable materials like metal or heavy-duty plastic for your compost bins. A three-bin system is excellent for managing different stages of composting, and using weather-resistant materials will ensure longevity.\\n\\n4. **Separation of Contents**: You can separate the compost into different bins for fresh waste, active composting, and finished compost. This helps in managing the composting process efficiently.\\n\\n5. **Additional Tips**: Regularly turn the compost to aerate it and speed up decomposition. Also, maintain a good balance of green (nitrogen-rich) and brown (carbon-rich) materials to ensure efficient composting.\\n\\nI hope these suggestions help you set up a successful compost system. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!\\n\\nBest regards,\\n[Your Name]\\n[Your Position]\"}"

Some of the grass is coming in nicely while other areas aren’t coming in as well as you can see in the attached images. \n1)\tWould you recommend I re-seed areas that aren’t coming in as well ASAP or would you wait a little longer? Because all the grass was planted on the same day, I’d assume since some new grass is already 1” tall, that if the seed was going to germinate it would have done so by now. I’m worried if I wait to long I’ll miss the window to get the seed down.\n2)\tWould you recommend I wait to re-seed if I can’t put seed down without walking on the new grass?\n3)\tWhen I re-seed, would you recommend I continue to water frequently to keep the newest grass seed moist, despite it probably being best to reduce the watering frequency for the recently germinated grass?\n4)\tI’m wondering why some areas germinated well and other’s did not. I’m thinking that a couple reasons some areas did not germinate well were\na.\tThey did not get as much water from the impact sprinkler.\nb.\tMaybe the seed to soil contact was not as good as it could have been. I only scarified the soil, threw seed down, and watered it frequently.\nI saw on the UMD website that verticutting and aerating the soil before re-seeding can help get good seed to soil contact. My concern is that if the seed drops to the bottom of the hole or slit, won’t it be too far under to germinate? I thought covering your seed with more than 1/4” of soil was too deep; but with a aerator the seed could be dropped up to 2” below the soil.\n\nAny guidance greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks!\nEddie\nExpert: Hi, Morgan,  You could re-seed the areas that aren't coming in well. Maybe it just didn't take like you mentioned the seed to soil contact didn't quite line up. Aerating is good to relieve soil compaction. and while some seed may fall down into the holes it will still help with overall germination, especially if a soil test revealed that it is low in nutrients and you need to add organic matter.  You could water as needed to keep the new seed moist enough to germinate. It shouldn't effect the germinated seed too much to the point of a disease or fungal growth.  If you didn't aerate and the soil is compacted, you could use a garden fork and work it into the ground in the areas that didn't germinate before you overseed again. Then rake the seed evenly over the area.  Emily\nUser: Good Evening Emily! Thanks for the suggestions. Does that mean I don't need to worry too much about stepping on the new grass when I overseed it with a rotary spreader? Thanks! Eddie\nExpert: Ideally you wouldn't walk on it but I think if you tread lightly and don't walk a lot it should be ok to overseed.\nUser: I'll be light as a feather when I overseed it today. Thanks, Emerson!"

For areas with poor or no germination, you can lightly scarify or aerate the soil to improve seed-to-soil contact before overseeding. This will help the new seeds establish better. In areas where you have about 50% or more germination, it's best to avoid disturbing the soil too much to prevent damaging the new grass. You can simply spread the seed and water it in these areas.

Carefully dig out the plants, ensuring you remove the entire root to prevent regrowth. This method is labor-intensive but effective for small infestations.\\n\\n2. **Cutting and Covering**: Cut the plant close to the ground before it flowers to prevent seed spread. Cover the area with a heavy-duty tarp or black plastic to block sunlight and suppress regrowth.\\n\\n3. **Herbicide Use**: If manual methods are not feasible, consider using a glyphosate-based herbicide. Apply it directly to the leaves on a calm day to minimize drift, and follow all label instructions to protect the surrounding environment, especially the creek.\\n\\n4. **Regular Monitoring**: After removal, regularly check the area for new growth and remove any new plants promptly.\\n\\n5. **Consult Local Authorities**: Contact local environmental or agricultural agencies for additional guidance and to ensure compliance with any local regulations regarding invasive species management.\\n\\nThese methods should help you manage the Giant Hogweed effectively while minimizing harm to the environment.\"}"

I am in Livonia, if that matters in any way.\nUser: Adding a few more photos in June and July showing Tenacity application. Thank you.\nExpert: Hello, Morgan I send this along to our weed expert, to confirm ID, please attach one or two more pictures of the nimblewill plant itself.  Take a small section dug up, laid out on a plain background, and photograph it from 8 inches away or so.   Spread out the stems and leaves  so we can see how they are arranged on the stem. Include a seedhead if possible.  It helps to put a coin or something beside it to give a sense of scale.  I attached a similar picture of nimblewill as an example of what is needed. Also, if you do not yet have them, here are Purdue’s and MSU’s Turf weed entries for nimblewill.  https://www.canr.msu.edu/ipm/diseases/nimblewill?language_id= https://turf.purdue.edu/nimblewill/\nUser: Thank you for your prompt reply.

Based on your description and the images, it seems like you are dealing with a persistent nimblewill problem. While Tenacity is a good option for controlling nimblewill, it can sometimes require multiple applications over a longer period to fully eradicate the weed, especially if it has a strong root system. Here are a few suggestions to enhance your control efforts:\\n\\n1. **Timing and Persistence**: Continue with the Tenacity applications as per the label instructions, but be prepared for multiple seasons of treatment. Nimblewill can be quite resilient, and it may take time to see complete results.\\n\\n2. **Cultural Practices**: Improve your lawn's health by overseeding with a desirable grass species that can outcompete nimblewill. Ensure your lawn is mowed at the recommended height and is receiving adequate water and nutrients.\\n\\n3. **Alternative Herbicides**: If Tenacity alone is not providing the desired results, consider consulting with a local extension office or a professional for alternative herbicides that might be more effective in your specific conditions.\\n\\n4. **Physical Removal**: For small patches, physical removal of the weed, including its roots, can be effective. This is labor-intensive but can prevent the spread of nimblewill.\\n\\n5. **Professional Help**: If the problem persists, you might want to consider hiring a professional lawn care service that can provide more targeted treatments.\\n\\nRemember, patience and persistence are key when dealing with nimblewill. Good luck, and feel free to reach out if you have more questions or need further assistance.\"}"

Organic mulches like shredded bark or wood chips are excellent choices. They decompose slowly, providing long-lasting coverage and improving soil quality over time. Cedar and cypress mulches are particularly known for their durability and natural oils that can help repel insects. Inorganic options like rubber mulch are also durable and effective at weed prevention, but they do not improve soil quality. To maintain a mulched bed, ensure the mulch layer is about 2-4 inches thick to effectively suppress weeds. Avoid piling mulch against the tree trunk to prevent rot. Refresh the mulch layer annually or as needed to maintain its effectiveness and appearance.\"}"

Check the soil moisture regularly and water only when the top inch feels dry.\\n\\n2. **Light**: While Klinki Pines prefer bright, indirect light, too much direct sunlight can cause stress. If the plant is in direct sunlight, consider moving it to a spot with filtered light.\\n\\n3. **Humidity**: These trees thrive in high humidity. Consider using a humidifier or placing a tray of water near the plant to increase humidity levels.\\n\\n4. **Temperature**: Maintain a consistent temperature around 68-77F. Avoid placing the plant near drafts or heat sources.\\n\\n5. **Pruning and Repotting**: Avoid pruning or repotting while the plant is stressed. Allow it to stabilize before making any further changes.\\n\\nMonitor the plant closely for any changes, and adjust care as needed. If the condition worsens, consider consulting a local plant expert for an in-person assessment. Good luck, and I hope your Klinki Pine recovers soon!\"}"

I had 2 carrot containers a swiss chard container & one big container with 4 different lettuce varieties. In the beginning everything first began to have purpling and then everything went necrotic and died. I cleaned the area with bleach, I'm using all new containers, and I just had a basil plant and 2 pepper plants begin to have these initial signs so frustrating. Different soil, mostly all different seed. And this is a portion of my crops I intend to put out for spring. So I was pretty bummed as u might figure. I culled everything I saw it on immediately. Last year I asked you guys, various seed companies and no one had what even seemed like a feasible or good suggestion. I got things like lack of phosphorus, but I wasn't lacking phosphorus plus they were still just seedlings. The the extension here blamed the fox farm ocean forest soil I was using(just like 40% the other 60% was inert coco), however I gave 2 plants to my sister before this outbreak or what have you happened, and hers were fine. Also I have used the soil before with good results as a partial component to my indoor growing mixes. I have everything in 7 inch greenhouse lids on 10x20 trays at this point, in part because I just didn't trust the environment after that loss. Then sure nuff 3 plants popped up with it. I included the 1 photo I thought to take. Really frustrated, so far it's just those 3 which promptly went in the garbage. It was wild all four separate containers and a separate pot too infected and destroyed. I neemed some of the things that were near it but not showing signs this time. Wish I had tried Neem before. But just curious if you have any thoughts on this.\n\nAlso what is a good high yielding purple asparagus strain for northern MN that I could search for 2 year crowns of, or if you know of a reasonable and reliable source to purchase such crowns that would be lovely too. \n\nThank you\nExpert: Thank you, Jordan for reaching out to ask2.extension.  I understand how frustrated you must be.   There are so many factors that could be involved, especially if you are losing more than one crop.  What kind of lighting is in your room?  How about the air movement?  Are you using a heat pad to start the seedlings?  Are they covered or uncovered?  Water amounts? what is the temperature of the room? So many factors to consider.I found examples of pictures of other peppers purpling like yours.  Lighting was agreed as the problem - too much light, either too, much too close or on too long. I had commercial greenhouses earlier in my life.  I used a seed starter mix, a tray like you did, heating pad and humidity dome or cover on the trays.  The seed starter has no nutrients in it, so is good for starting, but won’t last for growing and plants need to be transplanted after growing  true leaves ( shaped as they will look as they get bigger). First leaves have no difinitive shape.I found a site called pepper geek.com that gives a great run down on how to start peppers.  They use the fox farm soil, but not to start, just when transplanting. Might be a read for you for more insight for all plants. That so many of your crops are failing is puzzling. I’m hoping it’s temperature or lighting.  That’s easily fixed. I hope I can help you.   As far as purple asparagus, I bought Purple Passion.  I’m not 100% sure where I got it, but I think Gurneys.  It took a couple of years to get going really well, but now I’m 5+ years and getting more than two of us can eat.  I think I bought it two different years in a row to increase my production. Please let me know an answer to some of the questions above.  I really would like to help.\nUser: I have 5 80 watt LEDs on the side the problem popped back up on, I added some fox farm to the mix when transplanted. They are all under 7 inch greenhouse domes on 10x20 trays, they have pretty much all been covered, I did hit them with some weak dose fish emulsion. Temps range from 70-75 in this area of my room. I have fans going pointed at the lights. I did use a heat pad to start all the peppers and tomatoes, then switched them under the T5 to the LED and ditched the heat pad. Been trying to transplant on the second set of leaves, started out watering too much but remedied that at transplant and in general at this point. The crop I lost was open air fans moving good temps water was right, they started in big containers so no transplant was necessary. I'm pretty sure it was some kind of pathogen. But nothing was similar about this batch including the types of planted swiss chard is the only same one. And those are covered and in a different room all together. I was looking at purple passion and thought there might be a more productive purple hybrid as is the case with all the green asparagus, like most things it seems there are hybrids with better yield and disease immunity than heirlooms or OPs. I found a Amazon seller selling 2 yr old big crowns for 35$ for 20, I also have wild crowns that were years old I transplanted into our yard, and millennium I'm starting from seed. Think I might get the purple passion crowns for that price for variety and to have some I can take at least some of them next year. They got a return policy, which ya know, it's hard to be sure in your first 60 days, but I should have some idea. I want variety and don't wanna wait 3 years"

Typically, these sprays are more effective on smaller trees or shrubs where coverage can be more easily achieved. For large trees, professional arborists often use specialized equipment to ensure adequate coverage, such as high-pressure sprayers or aerial lifts. However, the effectiveness of these sprays on large trees can still be limited, and they are generally used as part of an integrated pest management strategy rather than a standalone solution. Soil treatments with systemic insecticides like imidacloprid are often preferred for large trees because they can be absorbed and distributed throughout the tree, providing more comprehensive protection. It's important to follow the guidance of local forestry experts and consider the specific conditions and health of your trees when deciding on treatment options. Additionally, while Kermes scale and drippy blight can be serious, they are not always fatal, and natural controls can sometimes manage the scale population. Prophylactic treatments can be considered for nearby trees, but it's best to consult with a local arborist to assess the risk and appropriate measures.\"}"

Some entire berries shriveled instead of maturing.  Other blackberry plants about 6-8 feet away look fine/normal.  All of the patch gets same watering and amount of sun.\nIs there treatment to save the affected plants?  or should I be ripping them out to avoid them affecting others?   There are plenty of new canes.  Does the 'infection' affect the entire plant, or just floricanes?   Is the soil likely infected, too?\nExpert: Hi- anthracnose and cane blight are common diseases of blackberry plants in MD. If the cane and fruit symptoms are widespread you may want to consider removing all plants. If the symptoms are more limited, prune out, bag, and discard all symptomatic canes (don't let the prunings touch the ground). These diseases infect floricanes and primocanes. They don't live in the soil but overwinter on infected plant parts.  Liquid lime sulfur is a low-risk \"organic\" fungicide labeled for use in the dormant season that can help control both diseases.

If this combination prevents yellow dandelions from going to seed, there will be no germination.  Deadheading dandelion with a string trimmer or mower will do the same.  The manufacturer says that this product kills dandelions but does not say how fast it arrests plant development.  If this product blows or drifts on to beneficial plants (tomatoes specifically, other possible), those plants will be damaged.  Some of the components are harmful to water life. The product lasts for several months in soil and can wash into waterways. Some of the components are harmful to pollinators. Some are not.

Rhododendron look scrawny with leaves  getting smaller and fewer and not as green as previously.  Help!!\nExpert: Hi, Jordan site conditions look challenging for the plants you have and in their planting combinations i.e. plants that prefer a little more shade and plants that like more sun and dryer soils. We can see juniper and spruce shrubs that thrive in full sun, dryer weather, and well draining soils. Boxwood, rhododenron and cherry laurel like fertile but well draining soil and prefer some afternoon shade.  1) Rhododendrons: You can review the link above for our Rhododendron Diagnostic page to learn about preferred growing conditions and common problems. They look like they are chlorotic meaning they need iron. Most of the time when rhodies are stressed with a nutrient deficiency it is due to the pH level being too high for the plants. They prefer more acidic soils. When the pH is not in the optimal range, it can cause the plant to struggle with the uptake of needed nutrients that are in the soil.  How much sun is it getting? Rhodies do best with morning sun and afternoon shade. In their native range in eastern Asia they are understory plants in wooded areas. With the Birds Nest Spruce near it we are assuming this is getting too much sun The location next to a foundation is rough for rhodies. This tends to cause the soil to be more alkaline due to the foundation. It also reflects heat off of the stone making it too hot for them. You can get a soil test done to determine the pH level and other nutrients that may not be in the optimal range, and adjust accordingly. It takes some time to lower the pH if it is needed. Or due to the sun, it may be better to relocate  the plant.  2) Cherry Laurel: You can review the link above for our Cherry Laurel Diagnostic Page to learn more about the favorable growing conditions and common problems for cherry laurel. The photo of the bare branched Cherry Laurel doesn't look like its covered in scale, but we can see some present. It does look too sparse to bring back though. We would recommend removing that one plant and any other branches on other plants that are showing scale. White prunicola scale (what cherry laurel typically get) is difficult to control with insecticides and typically we recommend pruning it out. With the cherry laurel along the foundation, we noticed that it looks like you are pruning them by cutting off the top and outer most growth or by shearing. When plants are sheared, it stimulates the outer most leaves to grow creating a dense outer growth with the sunlight not being able to reach the inner branches. This can stress the plant, lessen air flow and invite pests and disease issues. It is better to choose plants that will fit in the space when they reach their mature size as opposed to needing to prune to maintain a certain height or width. To remedy this situation now, you can thin the plants by removing some inner branches to let the light into the inner plant.  3) Boxwoods:The link above is to the diagnostic page for Boxwoods. Similarly with cherry laurel, boxwoods will get stressed when they are constantly sheared. We can't see any specific pests or diseases but the most common issue with boxwoods, especially those that are sheared is Volutella Blight fungal disease. Same as the cherry laurels, these can be thinned to help improve air circulation and growing conditions. There is no fungicide or chemical cure to cure this, but proper plant health is key. You can remove any dead or dying branches and clean up any fallen leaves under the plants to help reduce the fungal spores. Boxwoods come back easily from Volutella infections when properly pruned. Boxwoods are slow growing so be prepared to have some sparse looking plants when you prune and thin. They can rebound, but it takes time. If you don't want that in the front of your house, you could replace them and look for resistant cultivars. When pruning boxwood, you should do so in the spring preferably or at least before August so that the new growth will have time to harden off before winter. Boxwoods (and any other broadleaf evergreens like the Cherry Laurel and Rhodies) are more likely to get winter burn on the new growth that comes with pruning when a hard frost hits in the late fall/early winter. The link for Volutella has a helpful video on how to properly prune boxwoods. In general with any of these plants, we had a very dry season from Spring to Fall last year. Do you have a sprinkler system or did you supplement irrigation during that time? They could all be recovering from drought stress. Make sure to supplement water in times of drought. Mature established plants need at least 1 inch of water per week. You can feel the soil under the mulch at the base of the plants about 4-6 inches down to see if you should water. You can review our watering trees and shrubs reference page for guidance.  This is a lot of information, so feel free to go through it and ask any follow up questions.  Emily\nUser: Thak you so much. Very informative. I have mailed soil ssamples to U of DE for analysis. One other question, the rhododendrons seems to be growiung well at the bottom of the plant, is this indicative of something?Picture enclosed.ThanksOn Apr 30, 2024, at 11:38 AM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

Remove the top one to two inches of new primocanes when they are four feet tall. This causes the canes to branch, increasing next year’s yields. This will require several pruning sessions to tip each cane as it reaches the four foot height. Primocanes (suckers) that grow outside the hedgerow should be regularly removed. In the winter, remove the dead floricanes (old fruiting canes) from the hedgerow. Also shorten the lateral branches to about 1½ to 2½ feet.  The fact that it dies back completely each year is concerning.\nUser: We had the blackberry bush in our community garden for 6 years never had any berries. I been told they tried to dig it up to get rid of it with no success."

First, the lack of pruning could be affecting its productivity. Erect blackberries benefit from summer pruning to encourage branching and increase yields. Since the bush dies back completely each year, it might be experiencing winter damage or root issues. Additionally, the absence of fertilization could mean the plant lacks essential nutrients. I recommend starting a regular pruning schedule as described earlier, ensuring the plant is not exposed to harsh winter conditions, and considering a balanced fertilizer to support growth. If possible, test the soil to ensure it has the right pH and nutrient levels for blackberries. If these steps do not help, it might be worth consulting a local extension service to examine the plant and soil conditions more closely.\"}"

The plant is about 8 years old and I trim back about 1/3 of the shoots each fall.\nI have noticed a white, sticky substance on the underside of about 20% of the leaves. It coats the entire surface of some and seems to drip into leaves below it. There are also some small white eggs (?) and legged bugs on the underside of some leaves, maybe aphids, possibly part of causing it?  Anyone know what this might be and how to treat it? So far I've cut some of the deeply affected areas back and thrown them away. And cleaned my shears. \nI'd love to keep the plant healthy as the hummingbirds love it!\nExpert: Thank you for your question and pictures. Pictures are always helpful for us to see your problem. I agree with you that you have aphids on your honeysuckle vine. The sticky substance you're seeing is called honeydew which the aphids secrete after feeding on your plant. Aphids are not harmful unless there are large quantities of them and they are causing curling of leaves or other damage. There are many techniques to get rid of aphids. Pruning your vine is helpful and will stimulate growth. This Extension article will help answer a lot of questions about honeydew and controlling aphids on your vine: https://extension.umn.edu/yard-and-garden-insects/aphids Happy Gardening!\nUser: Thank you so much!

To encourage them to stay, you can release them in the evening when it's cooler and mist the plants with water to provide a more inviting environment. Additionally, since you have a garden with native plants and want to avoid pesticides, ladybugs are a suitable choice. Just ensure that the environment is conducive for them to thrive.\"}"

It’s been in the ground here in Sabillasville for over 20 years, and the last few years it just doesn’t seem to be doing well at all.  I took this picture yesterday.  No blooms at all this year or last.  It’s been at least 4-5 years since any real blooms.\nExpert: Hello, Harper. Unfortunately, the elongated, strappy foliage suggests that the tree has been harmed by accidental herbicide application/s. The most likely culprit would be chemical applications for lawn weeds that either drifted or on a hot day, volatilization (the conversion of a liquid chemical into a vapor, which escapes into the atmosphere). Pesticide/herbicide labels must be followed very carefully. The label is literally the law and lays out all the conditions to be careful of.  Here is our page that explains more:  https://extension.umd.edu/resource/herbicide-damage-flowers/ A good page from Indiana Extension: https://extension.illinois.edu/blogs/pesticide-news/2023-08-28-unintended-herbicide-injury-trees-growing-concern#:~:text=Typical%20injury%20symptoms%20of%20these,twisted%2C%20puckered%2C%20or%20curled.  It is doubtful that the tree can recover normally given how long you have been seeing this.

Christine\nUser: Dear, Avery,Thank you very much for replying to my email.  This is a real head scratcher because I have never allowed chemicals to be sprayed in the yard, etc.  Is it possible the Canadian fires could be the culprit?  None of my bushes or plants did well last year. This is so distressing, and upsetting.  I love that dogwood.   Is there nothing that can be done?Thank you again.JodiSent from my iPad On May 29, 2024, at 10:14 AM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:﻿"

Given the rural setting and the fact that nearby trees were sprayed for locusts, it's possible that your dogwood was affected by drift from those applications, even if you haven't used chemicals directly in your yard. While the Canadian fires could contribute to stress, they are less likely to be the primary cause of the specific symptoms you're seeing. Since the leaves are showing some signs of returning to normal, there might be a chance for recovery. I recommend ensuring the tree is well-watered, especially during dry spells, and applying a layer of mulch to help retain soil moisture and regulate temperature. Avoid any further chemical exposure and consider consulting a local arborist for an on-site evaluation. If the tree does not improve, replacement might be the best option, and the Marylanders Plant Trees program could be a helpful resource. Best wishes for your dogwood's recovery!\"}"

First, regarding pruning, it's generally recommended to prune cherry trees in late winter or early spring, just before the buds break. This timing helps minimize the risk of disease and allows you to shape the tree effectively. You are correct that removing entire limbs can be beneficial, especially if the top is becoming too dense. This will help improve air circulation and light penetration, which are crucial for fruit development. Additionally, ensure that your tree is not over-fertilized, as too much nitrogen can lead to excessive vegetative growth at the expense of fruit production. Finally, consider the possibility of alternate bearing, where trees produce a heavy crop one year and a lighter one the next. This is common in fruit trees and can be managed with consistent thinning of fruit in heavy years to balance the load. Keep monitoring the tree's health and adjust your care practices as needed.\"}"

It is not necessary to specify 'female' when referring to milking shorthorns in general, as the breed name implies milk production. However, in historical contexts or specific exhibitions, the term 'female' might have been used to emphasize the gender of the champion animal.\\n\\nI hope this helps with your label creation.

Sooty mold often appears as a black, powdery coating on leaves and other surfaces, and it can occur when there is a presence of honeydew, which is a sticky substance secreted by certain insects like aphids or scale insects. However, since you mentioned there are no visible insects, it might be a different type of mold or fungal spores that have spread due to the environmental conditions, such as the recent rain and humidity. \\n\\nTo control this issue, I recommend the following steps:\\n1. Clean the affected surfaces with a mild soap solution and water to remove the spots. This might require some scrubbing, especially on hard surfaces.\\n2. Ensure good air circulation around your plants by pruning any dense foliage.\\n3. Monitor your plants for any signs of insect activity, as they could be contributing to the problem indirectly.\\n4. Consider applying a fungicide if the problem persists, but make sure to choose one that is safe for the specific plants you have.\\n5. Keep an eye on the weather conditions and try to water your plants in the morning to allow the leaves to dry out during the day, reducing the likelihood of fungal growth.\\n\\nIf the problem continues or worsens, you might want to consult with a local extension office or a professional for a more detailed analysis.\"}"

We make sure it has been watered during this drought. Any thoughts?\nExpert: The growths on the bark pictured are lichen, a harmless organism that is not responsible for any plant damage and which does not need to be removed. We can't clearly see the leaf symptoms you describe, but it could be powdery mildew, or an array of fungal leaf spot infections caused by Phyllosticta or a group of fungi whose infections are collectively called Anthracnose. While they can be an eyesore when extensive and cause some premature leaf death and shedding, those diseases usually don't significantly impact long-term plant health.  Making sure the plant is regularly monitored for watering needs is all you can do for now. If leaves fall before autumn, try to collect them and dispose of them so they don't harbor spores under the tree, though if some blow away or can't be collected, it's not going to doom the tree. (Spores can always blow into the area from other regions in a future year, and plant disease spread and severity is often influenced heavily by the weather.)  Miri\nUser: Thank you so very much for your speedy answer about my maple. I will not worry about the lichen and will monitor my watering practices. I think the leaf damage may be leaf scorch from watering our lawn with the sprinkler during the heat of the day, it may have also hit the leaves. I usually try and water from the bottom, especially in this heat. It is a rough summer! Sent from my iPad On Jul 12, 2024, at 2:15 PM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:   ﻿"

Thanks, Charlie\nExpert: Hello, Charlie, Thank you for reaching out to the UVM Extension Master Gardener Helpline with your question about your tomato plant leaf. From your picture, the prognosis would most likely be Early Blight. Early Blight usually happens when fungal spores over wintering in the ground are splashed onto the bottom leaves of the tomato plant or brought there by an insect. I am attaching 2 really good resources with strategies to help remediate this problem. At the very least, you should make sure the plants are well weeded to allow for good air flow, place hay underneath to help stop the splash ups, pull off those lower leaves and dispose of them properly, if you water, make sure you don't water the leaves, and stake them up on a sunny day when the leaves are dry.  I am embedding two links with some information that you might find useful. The first link is from the UVM website. It explains some good gardening practices that will help keep tomato plants healthy.  It also has some photos so you will be able to visually compare Early Blight to Late Blight.  https://www.uvm.edu/sites/default/files/Extension-Community-Horticulture/Tomato_Problems_2016_2.pdf The second link is from the Missouri Botanical Garden and has a list of 6 specific integrated pest management strategies. https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/help-for-the-home-gardener/advice-tips-resources/insects-pests-and-problems/diseases/fungal-spots/early-blight-of-tomato I wish you the best of luck with your tomato plants and thank you for your question.\nUser: Thank you very much Lisa!   Larry   From: ask=<personal data hidden> <ask=<personal data hidden>> On Behalf Of Ask Extension Sent: Friday, July 26, 2024 9:37 PM To: Larry Mindell <<personal data hidden>> Subject: Re: Is this tomato blight?

It is in rough shape with damage that I presume to be sun scald, bug damage, and some kind of infection. It is the anchor of the back yard, providing so much of our needed shade and would be an expensive pain (and heartbreak) to remove. I'd appreciate any help on how to care for it.\n\nBackground:\nWhen I moved in 4 years ago I could see some signs of bugs. I noticed small ~1mm holes in the bark from some kind of bug. I did see Pigeon Tremexes on it from time to time but I can't say if that's the only bug responsible.\nThere was also some mild bark peeling that revealed insect tracks on the hard wood. The peeling bark has gotten much worse, primarily on the South or South/East aspect which makes me suspect sun scald even though it's a very mature tree. \n\nI had a respectable arborist company come in early 2023 to look at and trim trees as necessary. They thinned the crab apple tree quite a bit and offered to spray a pesticide which my wife declined. In the two summers since being trimmed the tree has taken a hard turn for the worse. Last summer it was primarily the bark peeling that progressed. And this year some branches failed to bud/fruit and many others got leaves just to drop them in late spring. \n\nAny advice is appreciated this tree means a lot to me.\n\nThanks"

Little green body by the thousands, covering at time the front and back porches.  The house is white so easy to see.\nWhat would be a safe pesticide to use on the house as well as spray strawberries, plants and to put on the lawn?  As well as the bark.\nWe do have a dog.\nExpert: Hey good morning!  You're experiencing a hatch, when thousands of midges emerge from their pupal cases all at once, flying to nearby lights. The hatch is likely to dissipate as quickly as it started, all on its own, but you do have options to protect your key living areas, like your porch and doorways. One low-impact option would be light management. Turn off the lights on your home for a few nights, and put lights in the yard far away from the house, drawing the midges to rest nearby.   This idea, and several more, are described in a handy fact sheet from North Carolina. If you choose to use an insecticide in your yard/bark area, consider using a pyrethroid (such as cyfluthrin, permethrin, tetramethrin, all ending in -thrin) because they are slightly repellent. As midges approach a treated surface, they might be repelled.   Use extreme care around the strawberries. If you use an insecticide on them, make sure it is registered (labeled) to be used on strawberry plants. If you follow the label directions, the residue shouldn't exceed the \"level of concern.\" It's always a good idea to wash fruits and vegetables before eating them, using a stream of water (not a bath), and some wiping/rubbing action. Here's a quick tip sheet on washing methods.   A stiff stream of water from the hose may also help, just to drive the population down/away from your protected spaces. Please let us know how it's going! Thanks for reaching out to OSU Extension.   All the best,  Kaci\nUser: Thank you for the information. These are the midges in question? Little different looking than the ones from North Carolina. RichardSent from my T-Mobile 5G Device-------- Original message --------From: Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> Date: 7/18/23 08:44 (GMT-08:00) To: Richard Weaver <<personal data hidden>> Subject: Re: Buzzer Midges?

Can you please help me identify the problems and provide treatment ideas?\n\nThanks.\nExpert: The azalea foliage symptoms look like mild lace bug damage (a very common pest on azaleas, especially if the plants are growing in lots of direct sun, which stresses them). There is also a small amount of leaf darkening or reddening that can also be attributed to environmental stress, possibly from drought or high heat. (Leaf reddening during winter is also normal for many azalea varieties, and it's due to similar conditions -- stress from temperature or inaccessible soil moisture -- during that time of year.) A location next to a wall can compound summer stress by reducing air circulation, reflecting extra light, and contributing to heat build-up and soil drying.  No management for lace bug needs to be done now, and you can monitor the plant for a new generation of lace bugs next spring. If you intervene, options are included in the page linked above, though usually only a strong spray of plain water from a garden hose or a few treatments of horticultural oil or insecticidal soap are needed to suppress their numbers. Either method must contact the leaf undersides to be effective, as that is where lace bugs will be living and laying their eggs.  Were the azaleas monitored for watering needs this summer? If not, start checking them periodically and watering as needed (once the soil becomes somewhat dry to the touch around five inches down) so they can maintain healthy roots and not lose flower buds that have formed for next spring's bloom.  The milkweed discoloration is hard to diagnose, but it does not appear to be due to disease or any pest activity; it too looks like a result of environmental stress. No action needs to be taken, and if nothing else is going on unrelated to the leaf symptoms, then the plant should go dormant as usual later this autumn and regrow normally next year. Is this a Swamp Milkweed? (It looks like it is.) If so, it is growing in moist soil? If also affected by drought, the plant's roots would fare better if periodically watered during dry spells. Cecil County, like much of Maryland, experienced notable drought for at least part of this past year, and is currently abnormally dry again.  Miri\nUser: Thank you for the quick response.  We will monitor watering needs better.  I was curious about the white fuzzy growth on the ends of two branches?  There are about 15 on the plant.  Should I cut them off?   Thanks again, Shirley"

Remove the top one to two inches of new primocanes when they are four feet tall. This causes the canes to branch, increasing next year’s yields. This will require several pruning sessions to tip each cane as it reaches the four foot height. Primocanes (suckers) that grow outside the hedgerow should be regularly removed. In the winter, remove the dead floricanes (old fruiting canes) from the hedgerow. Also shorten the lateral branches to about 1½ to 2½ feet.  The fact that it dies back completely each year is concerning.\nUser: We had the blackberry bush in our community garden for 6 years never had any berries.

Firstly, the lack of pruning could be a significant factor. Erect blackberries benefit from summer pruning to encourage branching and increase yields. Since your bush dies back completely each year, it might be experiencing winter dieback, which can be caused by harsh winter conditions or disease. Additionally, the absence of fertilization might mean the plant is not receiving adequate nutrients to support fruit production. I recommend starting a regular pruning routine as described earlier, ensuring the plant is protected during winter, and considering a balanced fertilizer to support growth. If possible, review the pictures for any signs of disease or other issues that might not have been mentioned.\"}"

Three of them assessed the issue to be a leaf spot fungus.  They sent me back home with a fungicide called \"Copper Fungicide\".  I proceeded to remove all affected leaves as they would not recover and thoroughly sprayed the rest of the plant with Copper Fungicide.  Now today I notice the same thing starting to show up on all five plants again, but this time there are many leaves which have turned yellow. The yellow leaves seem to be more within the lower part of the plant.  Back to a different reputable nursery and the person I spoke with semi agreed that it was a fungus problem and to keep using the spray.  Personally, after looking at photos online of this leaf spot fungus, I don't think my plant's leaves really look that similar to those on line.   Sooooooo.... I am wondering if there could be some sort of nutritional problems where the soil just isn't the right PH or not enough iron or whatever.  Or could they be getting too much sun?  They are in total shade until about 11:30 when they finish out the day in fun sun. Hopefully these photos will show well enough for you to get a good idea of what could be possibly be going on here. Totally appreciate you assistance here !!!"

While the initial diagnosis was a leaf spot fungus, the symptoms of yellowing leaves, particularly in the lower parts, could also indicate a nutrient deficiency or sun stress. Since you are considering using garden netting to provide some shade, that could be a beneficial step to reduce sun stress. Additionally, ensure that the soil pH is suitable for hydrangeas, which prefer slightly acidic conditions. You might want to conduct a soil test to check for any nutrient deficiencies, particularly iron, which can cause yellowing if deficient. Adjusting the watering schedule to ensure deep watering might also help, as shallow watering can lead to stress. If the problem persists, consulting with a local extension service for a more detailed analysis might be helpful.\"}"

It has clearly been there quite a while but has not been a problem till yesterday and we didn't know it was there till then.  But yesterday one of our dogs was stung once and when I went to find out what was going on I saw a large number of hornets, gotstung myself, and saw that both dogs were being stung.\nWe kennel our three dogs at least once every week or so meaning I need to be rid of this thing soon.  Having the hornets just leave would be ok as well as just destroying it/them. \nIf I've not identified the insects correctly please correct that.\nPictures attached.\nExpert: I am so sorry to hear about your dog. Yes, these nests can build for month before they are noticed.   A few things about yellowjacket biology may be useful here (and yes, the black and white bald-faced \"hornets\" are just another species of yellowjacket). First, the nests are not perennial, they are annual. In fact, the nest is now reaching its peak population and should begin crashing within a month. The colony should be completely dead by November.   If you cannot avoid the nest until it collapses you will need to kill the nest. Given its height, I would recommend bringing in a pest control professional. To do it yourself would involve climbing a ladder and spraying an insecticide formulated for yellowjacket control into the entrance of the colony (which is the hole at the bottom of the nest). There is a risk that the yellowjackets could fly out at you while on the ladder, causing you to loose balance and fall.   There is a great (out of print) University of Idaho Extension document that goes over your options. You can download it here: https://beav.es/pRT\nUser: Dr., Thank you very much for your comments and the link to a fascinating paper from Idaho.  I have a cannister, Spectracide PRO, wasp and hornet killer.  Its active ingredients are .10% tetramethrin; .25% permethrin; and .50% piperonyl butoxide.  It asserts that it has a 20 ft spray reach. We need to use the dog runs, as soon as the end of this week, so I can't wait. My plan is to wait till late twilight or full nightfall and from a reasonable distance spray the entrance of the nest and then the entire nest till it appears wet.   Will the darkness provide me any protection from the hornets? Will one treatment likely be enough? Again, thank you very much for the help. Bill\nExpert: Hi, Riley,   I know, isn't the Idaho publication great?  In my experience an application of a pyrethroid-based insecticide like the one you list should work with a single application. Read the instructions on the label carefully. I am looking at an example of this product label (which may differ from the one you have) and it does warn not being directly under the nest, as you will be dispensing a large volume that could potentially drip back on you. Also note the label specifies watching the wind conditions (although in the enclosed space, the risk of wind may be minimal) as it could cause the spray to drift back onto you. Applying at sunset is recommended on the label and the wasps will be less active (but not totally inactive). Make sure to have a plan to get into cover if the wasps to fly off the nest (i.e., think about where you will go if there are wasps flying around, ideally through a door you can close or into dense shrubbery). It would be prudent as well to let someone else in the household know when you are making the application who you can check-in with. Finally, when done with the application, check the directions on how to dispose of the product after use.   Good luck out there.\nUser: Again, Thank you very much – really, really appreciate you info and advice.  Will comply.  I’ll let you know tomorrow how all this went.  Bill From: ask=<personal data hidden> [mailto:ask=<personal data hidden>] On Behalf Of Ask ExtensionSent: Tuesday, September 17, 2024 2:47 PMTo: chenowethSubject: Re: Hornets' nest (#0155079)"

Now I'm wondering if this is the same flower that has bloomed every year or my husband's picture is of a different flower and the original was killed. The flower was always at least 4 foot tall, sometimes more. It's not close to our house so it has always been noticeable from a distance. We definitely will stake the area and hope it comes back next year. It was irresponsible of the workers to spray our yard with defolient. The ironic part is that the weeds are growing just fine at the base of the pole they sprayed. Oh, well. I feel fortunate to have a source that can identify plants. Wish we'd taken photos when the original plant existed.  Thank you again. Susan Schaefer   On Wednesday, July 31, 2024 at 09:27:43 AM EDT, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

The shape of the tree is where the branches spread out and then up just a little bit. It has buds on it but everyone else’s are in full bloom. What can we do to have it more the shape of most other  ones we’ve seen? We have only pruned some branches that were below the ones you see in pictures. What can be done; should we prune back the present branches or should we replant it? It gets sun most of the day.\nExpert: Thanks for the question.  I need two pieces of information from you. 1).  You said that the tree is two years old.  That would imply you planted it in 2022.  If so, when during 2022 did you plant it? 2).  From your picture, it would appear that under the rock mulch there is some black fabric.  Is that correct (that might be part of your problem)? Looking forward to you getting back to us.  Thanks for consulting with us.\nExpert: Thought of one more piece of information that I need.  When specifically did you do your last pruning? Many thanks.\nUser: WI’m pretty sure we planted it about the end of July. Yes but the black fabric is way away from where the tree was planted.

To begin with, it is a fruitless and exasperating exercise to compare your hydrangea with those of others. There are so many different varieties of hydrangea that such comparisons yield little in the way of useful information. Some comments: 1). It appears that the current appearance of the hydrangea may not be what you expected. What you have is a hydrangea tree. This was originally a hydrangea bush but was extensively pruned to make it look more like a tree. If you would like it to have more of bush shape, do no more pruning in the lower portion of the plant where currently there are no branches. New branches should occur in this area though it will take some time. In a more realistic vein, for the next few years you will have a hydrangea tree and not a bush. 2). In its current location, the hydrangea is most likely under stress from insufficient water and nutrients. Instead of moving it, do two other things.  a). The plant behind the hydrangea and to the right looks to be an American Germander. It is way too close to the hydrangea. It should be moved. Right now it is drawing water nutrients away from the hydrangea. b). Secondly, the fabric under the rock mulch is impeding water and nutrient flow to the hydrangea roots. The small area right next to the hydrangea in which the fabric has been removed is not sufficient. Remove the rock mulch and the fabric all around the hydrangea out to a distance of at least two feet from the hydrangea base. Then put wood mulch down where you had removed the rock mulch. Keep this wood mulch about a foot away from the base of the hydrangea. That will remain an area of bare dirt. See the following: https://www.yourgreenpal.com/blog/dont-kill-your-trees-make-sure-you-are-mulching-them-the-right-way 3). With respect to flowering, I don’t think there should be concern at this point. Your Pink Diamond hydrangea flowers on “old wood”. This means that flowers in one particular year come from buds formed in the previous year. As is typical for hydrangea using old wood, your Pink Diamond should bloom in late spring to early summer. See: https://www.provenwinners.com/learn/care/pruning-shrubs-part-2-when-best-time-prune - :~:text=Flowering on old wood means,buds for the following year. Here’s the deal. When you planted this hydrangea in July 2022, it may or may not have had blooms on it. However during 2022, the hydrangea was expending most of its energy on establishing a strong root system. Most likely and for this reason, your hydrangea formed few buds for 2023 blooming. I would expect that you saw few blossoms in 2023 and any that you might have seen, probably looked rather anemic. You currently have many buds, but they are not blooming. I suspect this is largely attributable to your hydrangea being unable to obtain sufficient water and nutrients due to the cloth under the rock mulch and/or adverse competition from the other nearby plants. If you do what I suggested in 2.b. above, this issue should largely be resolved. I would fully expect that you will see much improved blooming in the 2025 growing season. 3). At this point, do NO MORE pruning. For hydrangea such as yours, the only time to do pruning is early summer. 4). Keep your hydrangea well- watered (at least twice a week) starting now (mid-August 2024) and continue doing so up until the first frost (probably around mid -October). 5). In mid-September, add a winter shrub fertilizer around the base of the hydrangea over the newly laid-down wood mulch. Thoroughly water it in. This fertilizer should be available at any Anoka gardening center. This type of fertilizer will slowly release nutrients into the soil and prepare your hydrangea to commence vigorous flowering in June 2025. Be sure that the word “winter” appears on the fertilizer bag. Also look at the product label for the nitrogen components. Be sure that the word “urea” appears among these components. See: https://ecowhizz.co.za/choosing-the-right-fertilizer-for-winter/ - :~:text=Slow-Release Fertilizers%3A Consider using,or “controlled-release”. If you start these procedures now (mid-August 2024), I feel quite confident that come spring 2025 you will see an improvement in your hydrangea. Good luck. Please get back to me if you have any further, related questions.\nUser: Thank you for your reply. I think I didn’t explain myself very well. We know it’s a Pink Diamond tree and that’s what we wanted as we have other hydrangea bushes in our yard. I measured and the black fabric is close to a foot from the trunk. We will remove more. We will have figure out what to do about the rock as it’s a large area and I dislike the rock a lot and it’s hard to walk on and we are used to mulch but to hire someone to remove as much rock as we have is not affordable. I do think that it gets plenty of water as we hand water this whole area by hand and so we water at least the flower pots everyday when we haven’t got rain that day. It’s almost every other day if mild and we’ve had rain and if warm every day. I have a rain gauge app so I know how much rain we have right where we live. What we want is to have is a hydrangea tree and that is has a more round shape and not this flat top that we have. We only pruned the branches that we did because they were below the ones that are there and too low for a tree. This was to grow to a height of 8 feet and a spread of six feet. This doesn’t have any branches growing upwards and it has a very flat look to it. This is what I wanted you to know about. So I do understand the need for the winter fertilizer and what you’ve recommended but how can the shape of it change?BonnieSent from my iPhone On Aug 17, 2024, at 1:18 PM, Ask Extension wrote:﻿\nUser: Also is it not right that it will grow from the top as right know I just see as a short tree and nothing like or close to 8 Ft.

Avoid pruning the top branches, as this can lead to a flat appearance. Instead, prune any lateral branches that are growing too horizontally. This will encourage the plant to direct its energy towards vertical growth.\\n\\n2. **Nutrient and Water Management**: Continue with the recommended watering schedule, ensuring the tree receives consistent moisture, especially during dry spells. Removing more of the rock mulch and black fabric will help improve water and nutrient absorption. \\n\\n3. **Fertilization**: Apply the winter shrub fertilizer as previously advised.

This year only a few leaves have emerged and it appears that young branches are dying back. It was pruned rather aggressively in January and fertilized with Kelp, Humic, and Fulvic Liquid Fertilizer. Can you say what went wrong, and can it be saved?\nExpert: Hello, Taylor, Thank you for your question regarding your peach tree. As you may already know, flowers appear before the leaves. Did you notice a standard amount of flowers this year? I wouldn't be too concerned yet. Leaves will generally appear on the newer scions (the newer woody growth). I see lots of new growth, just not new leaves yet. The leaves that have appeared look normal from the photos you sent. If you are able to send a photo of the base of the tree where it meets the ground and a closeup photo of a leaf, that would be helpful. Also how many hours of sun does the tree get? Thank you, QuinnHorticulture Program CoordinatorCSU Extension El Paso County\nUser: Hi, Jamie,    Thank you for the response. There weren’t any flowers at all this year, and it appears that the new growth is dying back. Through the winter and earlier this spring the small new growth was all green and looking healthy, but now you can see that the ends of the branches are turning brown. The few leaves that have emerged do look healthy though, as you observed.    I noticed that there is a large spot on the trunk that’s oozing sap, which I don’t recall happening in the past - see new photos attached. Some of the sap has made it to the ground.    The tree gets about 6-8 hours of direct sun at this time of the year.     Jerry    Get Outlook for iOS  From: ask=<personal data hidden> <ask=<personal data hidden>> on behalf of Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> Sent: Wednesday, May 31, 2023 5:06 PM To: Jerry Crisafulli <<personal data hidden>> Subject: Re: Peach tree only partially leafed out (#0102403)"

The symptoms you're describing, such as the lack of flowers, dieback of new growth, and sap oozing from the trunk, could indicate a few potential issues. One possibility is a bacterial infection like bacterial canker, which can cause dieback and sap oozing. Another possibility is stress from the aggressive pruning combined with environmental factors. To help your tree, I recommend the following steps: \\n\\n1. Ensure proper watering, especially during dry spells, but avoid overwatering as this can exacerbate root issues.\\n2. Consider applying a balanced fertilizer to support recovery, but avoid over-fertilizing.\\n3. Monitor the tree for any additional signs of disease or pest activity.\\n4. Consult with a local arborist or extension service for an on-site evaluation, as they can provide a more accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.\\n\\nI hope this helps, and I wish you the best in reviving your peach tree.

Based on the characteristics you've described and the images, it seems like you might be dealing with a type of invasive vine, possibly something like a wild rose or a bramble, which are known for their thorny stems and aggressive growth. To eradicate it completely, you can follow these steps: \\n\\n1. **Cutting and Digging:** In early spring, cut the vine back to the ground. Then, dig out as much of the root system as possible. This is labor-intensive but can be effective in reducing regrowth.\\n\\n2. **Chemical Control:** After cutting, apply a systemic herbicide like glyphosate to the freshly cut stems. This will help the chemical penetrate into the root system. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for safe and effective use.\\n\\n3. **Monitoring and Reapplication:** Monitor the area for new growth and reapply the herbicide as needed. It may take several applications to fully eradicate the vine.\\n\\n4. **Preventive Measures:** Consider planting ground cover or other plants that can compete with the vine to prevent it from re-establishing.\\n\\nIf you are unsure about using chemicals or need further assistance, consulting with a local extension service or a professional landscaper might be beneficial.\"}"

It is not as commonly planted in urban settings, possibly due to its preference for cooler, moist environments and its moderate tolerance to urban pollution. For a city yard, you might consider other large shade trees known for their structural integrity, such as the northern red oak (Quercus rubra) or the bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), both of which are known for their strong wood and resistance to splitting. Additionally, the American elm (Ulmus americana) has been bred for disease resistance and can be a robust choice. When selecting a tree, consider factors such as the tree's mature size, growth rate, and specific site conditions. Regular pruning and proper care can also enhance a tree's structural integrity and longevity.\"}"

Do you see any damage to the stems on the bottom side?  I saw Cicada damage on a limb tip earlier today that was not noticed by the home owner. I showed the homeowner the damage to one of their foundation plants next to their home that looks similar to what is pictured in you photos you provided. r/mart\nUser: Good morning,They are in direct morning sun until about noon, then mainly shade.  I have noticed some wilting of individual branches over the years, but not to this extent or die off like this. I've always just cut them out. I'm not sure what to look for as far as fungal spots. I see tiny black spots on the backs of the leaves. I took some close ups of those.  I did not see any Cicadas around the shrub area.  Here are more pictures. I've also included one from down the row that is beginning to show some stress as well.  We are so sad to see these dying. I worked so hard 4 years ago to install these for a hedge and now it looks like we will loose them.  I have put about 50 gallons of drip irrigation on these in that last week as soon as I realized they were so dry.

Pruning the Viburnum back can help it recover, but avoid cutting it all the way to the ground unless it's severely damaged. Instead, remove any dead or damaged branches to encourage healthy growth.

But everything growing in the terraced gardens has always thrived. \n\nI've attached pictures of the tree. Thank you for your help!\nExpert: Good morning Nicole and thank you for reaching out to ask2.extension. I would guess there may be something wrong with the soil your tree is in, especially if you can’t get anything to grow.  My suggestion would be to have a soil test done on the soil in the boulevard.  It could be a number of things from imbalance in the nutrients to salt or chemicals from snow removal to the possibility of your railroad ties.  It’s hard to say. If you go to Extension.umn.edu and search for soil testing.  Click on ‘Tests your soil this spring’ and read that article.  You will see University of Minnesota in red letters.  Click on that and you will be taken to a site that will go over with you where to get the forms,  how to do the test and where to send the soil sample.  I think if you want a tree in the boulevard you really need to do this. Good luck and I hope this will help solve your issues.\nUser: Thank you so much! In the meantime, should I trim the dead branches? On Sat, May 27, 2023 at 8:56 AM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: You could, cutting them off as close to the tree as smoothly as you can. It honestly amazes me they planted a tree there at all.  There is so little room for the roots to spread out.  Looking at the pictures, I definitely think it’s a problem with the soil.\nUser: You're right--it is a super narrow boulevard, but there are trees all up and down the block that are doing really well! I think you're right, too, that it has to be the soil. I will definitely do the soil test. Cross your fingers for me!

        "value": "User: Hello, Taylor plan to remove some weed trees that have grown on the line between us and our neighbor. We'd like to then plant cedar hedges in their place. The weed trees are a variety of broadleaf species (one is a maple) and they've reach about 7-9ft in height with a sprawling canopy of maybe 6 ft in diameter. These trees are relatively small and have a trunk of just a few inches in diameter.\n\nWhat we're wondering is if we need to remove the whole stump and root system of these trees before we try to plant cedars near by? The cedars would be planted a few inches back from where the weed trees are. Of course, a lot of roots will need to be removed in order to create a hole big enough to put the cedar roots in. Are there any risks to the cedars involved by leaving what we can of the weed tree stumps and roots in the ground? Some articles we've found talk about how dead roots left in the ground will rot, possibly attracting fungus and pests that are harmful to the new plants going in.\n\nLooking forward to your advice.

We have an area we are setting up for them that is currently 100% tall fescue.  My plan is to mow it low, spray with diluted glyphosate to kill the grass, wait 1 week, mow it low again so it is basically a dry lot, then turn them out on it.  \n\nMy question is, is 1 week acceptable wait time after spraying diluted glyphosate to put the ponies on that area?  This area has never had glyphosate sprayed on it before (at least not for the past 20 years). \n\nThank you!\n\nBrad\nExpert: Brad: Your plan is a reasonable one but first I would suggest that you follow label directions for use of the glyphosate to ensure that you get the control you are hoping for. Following the initial spraying you might need to wait longer than a week to see what level of control you go on the tall fescue. Depending o the result you may want to consider a second application of herbicide. When a pasture is treated this way prior to renovation it is a general plant to go with a double application of the herbicide to get good control on the fescue. Once you have the desired control you can wait 1 - 2 weeks before turning  the ponies into the dry-lot.  In general if you are using a product (Round-Up) is does not persist in the environment for very long.  If you have further questions you can contact me at <personal data hidden>\nUser: Hi,Thank you for this input.  This plan worked well for our ponies.We are now preparing the rest of the pasture to bring our thoroughbred gelding that will be arriving after we get our fences up in about 1 month.  We currently have a mainly tall fescue lawn/pasture that is maybe 10% weeds.  One of them is in the attached pictures.  Can you identify this?  I was leaning towards Nimblewill. My plan for the thoroughbred pasture is below:1.

The curling and browning of leaves could be due to a combination of factors including stress from the hard pruning, potential residual effects of the Putnam scale, or even the horticultural oil application. Additionally, the alkaline soil could be affecting nutrient uptake, particularly iron, which blueberries are sensitive to. I recommend continuing to monitor the pH levels and ensuring they are within the optimal range for blueberries, which is typically between 4.5 and 5.5. You might also consider reducing the frequency of horticultural oil applications, as excessive use can sometimes cause leaf damage, especially in hot weather. Lastly, ensure that your drip irrigation is providing consistent moisture, as fluctuations can also stress the plants. If the problem persists, a soil test and a closer inspection for any remaining pest issues might be necessary. I hope this helps!\"}"

I don't think these are ladybug larvae. I see ladybug larvae in my garden often. If you note the shape of the abdomen, the ladybug larvae has a pointed abdomen, the insects in question have a rounded abdominal shape. They also do not appear to be in a larval form, they look like small adult insects. I know my photo is not the best. I have the advantage of seeing it \"in person\", but not sufficient  knowledge  to identify these insects. They may be ladybug eggs, and these insects may be devouring them.

Rats can carry various pathogens, including bacteria like Salmonella and Leptospira, which can potentially contaminate soil. However, the risk of these pathogens being present in your soil depends on several factors, including the extent of contamination and environmental conditions. Since you've already cleaned the area and are considering deterrents and trapping, these are good steps to minimize future contamination. If you are still concerned, you might consider removing the top layer of soil where the droppings were most concentrated, or you could opt to use raised beds with fresh soil for planting this year. Additionally, implementing row covers or a greenhouse, as you mentioned, can help protect your plants from future contamination. If you decide to use the existing soil, ensure thorough washing of any produce and consider using gloves when handling the soil. If you have any further concerns, consulting with a local extension service or a soil testing lab for specific pathogen testing might provide additional peace of mind.\"}"

The CSU extension is such a wonderful resource, and this Coloradan greatly appreciates your help. My wife and I were fortunate to purchase a house last year with a gorgeous ash that is about 35 years old. We recently had the ash treated for EAB and the Arborist mentioned that it has a poor structure and should be structurally pruned. They quoted us 2000$ which was quite a sticker shock. We want to take great care of our tree, but I am having trouble understanding some of the topics around pruning. Can someone please help me with these pruning questions? Can you please help me understand why 'urban' ash trees require pruning, even if they are not endangering any structures, when natural ash trees have longer lifespans and do not receive pruning? I don't mean to be dense, I am genuinely trying to understand. When is the best time to prune? I have heard conflicting things - my Arborist says any time is ok, but I've also heard it should only be done in winter. What is correct?The Arborist recommended a structural pruning every five years. Does this seem reasonable? They also recommended a fertlization that costs about $200. We mulch our grass and yard clippings and apply compost and pellet fertilizer 2x a year. Is more fertilization really beneficial? Thank you for all of your time and help. I hope you have a great rest of your day. Best, John"

Let's address your questions one by one. \\n\\n1. **Pruning Urban Ash Trees:** Urban ash trees often require pruning to maintain their health and safety. Unlike natural settings, urban environments can impose stress on trees due to limited space, soil compaction, and pollution. Pruning helps to manage the tree's structure, reduce the risk of limb failure, and improve air circulation and light penetration, which can enhance the tree's overall health.\\n\\n2. **Timing of Pruning:** While some arborists may suggest that pruning can be done at any time, the best time to prune ash trees is during their dormant season, typically in late winter. This timing minimizes the risk of disease and pest infestation and allows the tree to heal more effectively as it enters the growing season.\\n\\n3. **Pruning Schedule:** A structural pruning every five years is a reasonable recommendation for maintaining the health and structure of your ash tree, especially if it has been identified as having poor structure. Regular pruning can help prevent future issues and extend the tree's lifespan.\\n\\n4. **Fertilization Needs:** Given that you already mulch, compost, and apply pellet fertilizer twice a year, additional fertilization may not be necessary unless a soil test indicates specific nutrient deficiencies. Over-fertilization can sometimes do more harm than good, so it's best to base any additional fertilization on the specific needs of your tree and soil conditions.\\n\\nI hope this helps clarify your concerns. Feel free to reach out if you have more questions or need further assistance. Best wishes for the care of your beautiful ash tree!\"}"

        "value": "User: We have a 300+ year old Wye Oak tree in the corner of our backyard.  The 80-100 ft canopy covers about 80% of our backyard.  We have lived in this house for 33 years.  This is the first time I remember a sticky clear substance from the tree (?) covers those areas under the canopy.  We have mostly lawn under the tree but in the perimeter of the yard are various types of plants and bushes.  I noticed a shine on the hydrangea leaves and it felt sticky.  Then I felt the lawn itself which also felt sticky.  Grass and plants NOT under the canopy were not sticky or have that shine. So I am assuming this substance is from the oak tree. Could this be due to the lack of rain we have had over the last month?  Should I make a point of watering the area?\nExpert: Instead of sap, we suspect the sticky residue is in fact honeydew, the sugar-water-like waste produced by a variety of sap-sucking insects. Species of soft scale insect, such as the aptly-named Oak Lecanium Scale, are a possible culprit, though would be hard to detect directly unless there are limbs low enough that would allow you to inspect the twigs for the characteristic lumps of mature scale shell-like covers. Another potential culprit is the nymphs (juveniles) of Spotted Lanternfly [SLF], though they too would be hard to find in the canopy since they're small and dark-colored at the current life stage. Aphids, leafhoppers, and treehoppers are also all possibilities, though none of those three would be damaging to need treatment. SLF can appear overwhelming when abundant but don't damage oaks enough to warrant insecticide use either. Scale can be abundant on a tree for several years before they tax its vigor or cause dieback, so while it might be worth making sure that's the only issue, they won't necessarily need treatment (which would entail insecticide use that could potentially impact other insects or wildlife in the process).  We suggest you have the tree assessed by a certified arborist. Some are employed by tree-care companies (though not all tree-care company employees have this certification level individually) but others consult independently if you're concerned about a bias towards costly treatments or other tree company services. You can also always get a second opinion from a second arborist if you wish because very few tree problems will leave you with little time to act on them. (Plus, trees in decline often began that downward spiral months or years before symptoms became evident, so even then, seemingly-sudden issues are actually somewhat long-term.)  If the tree's canopy still looks good and not conspicuously sparse or with sections of dead major branches, it's prognosis is probably good, and intervention, aside form the diagnostic effort itself, is probably not needed. Watering may indeed be beneficial, not necessarily for this issue in particular but in general to ease tree stress. Maryland and much of this region has had below-average rainfall so far this year, and we are currently back in a moderate drought status in several counties, including Baltimore. Feel the soil around six inches deep in the tree's root zone. If damp to the touch at that depth when probed, the tree probably has sufficient moisture as-is. If instead the soil feels somewhat dry to the touch at that depth, then irrigating its entire root zone (or as much as is practical) may help it avoid more stress. You can then wait until the soil becomes similarly dry that far below the surface before irrigating again.

Here are a few tips to help them thrive: \\n\\n1. **Watering**: Since you're using a moisture meter, aim to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Dragon Wing Begonias prefer slightly moist soil, so if the meter shows green, you're likely in a good range.\\n\\n2. **Sunlight**: These plants do well in partial shade to partial sun. Since they are getting less than half a day of full sun, this should be adequate. If you notice the leaves getting scorched, consider providing a bit more shade.\\n\\n3. **Fertilization**: Consider using a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the growing season to promote healthy growth.\\n\\n4. **Pest Control**: You've already taken steps to deter deer, which is great. Keep an eye out for other pests like aphids or whiteflies, and treat them as needed.\\n\\n5. **Pruning**: If the deer have caused any damage, you can prune back any damaged stems to encourage new growth.\\n\\nBy following these guidelines, your begonias should continue to grow well.

You can also consider applying a dormant oil spray to smother any overwintering eggs. In early spring, monitor the plants closely for any signs of caterpillars or other pests. If you notice caterpillars, you can use Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), a natural insecticide that targets caterpillars specifically.

This is on a new patio with a little shade, depending on the time of day.\nHe asked me for the names of plants which would survive 12 months in those pots. \nAny thoughts?\nThanks\nExpert: Thanks for the question. You are facing a tough challenge. Ramsey County is between growing zones 4 and 5. Typically what this means is that any plants in outdoor pots will be subjected to being frozen. A general rule of thumb for keeping plants in containers outside during the winter is to use plants adapted for a lower growing zone than for plants you would normally grow there. Even better would be a growing zone two levels below the zone for the area. In other words, being in zone 4 to 5, you should select plants rated for zone 3 or even zone 2. This growing zone should be indicated on the plant tag. More specifically here are some possibilities: 1). Evergreen shrubs such as boxwood, yew, and junipers; 2). Ornamental grasses provided that they are listed for zone 3 3). Sedums such as stonecrop and creeping 4). Certain Hellebores, again provided that they are listed for zone 3 5). Some dwarf evergreens such as dwarf Alberta spruce and dwarf Japanese cedar However regardless of the planting, these outside containers will need winter preparation. This includes having the container in a sheltered location, such as against a wall or near a building. This may present a problem if the containers being used are heavy and not easily relocatable. The containers should be heavily mulched and, if possible, wrapped with some type of insulating blanket. Water the plants well before freezing temperatures arrive and then after that only sparingly. Bottom line is that annual work and maintenance will be required to keep things alive over the winter. Your landlord will need to provide for this to be done every fall. See the following for further information on these and other related points: https://www.hgtv.com/outdoors/landscaping-and-hardscaping/10-winter-friendly-plants-for-your-outdoor-space-pictures https://www.hgtv.com/outdoors/gardens/garden-styles-and-types/the-cold-hard-facts-on-protecting-potted-plants Good luck.

I wanted to add that although no frass evident there are a few leaves showing some black moldy areas as well as a few grey/black stains per pic.\nExpert: Hi, Avery you were having difficulty editing, but we got the photos and information either way. Peppers rarely suffer from insect feeding damage, and what you're seeing is likely due to a caterpillar or beetle chewing on some of the leaves. It probably will not defoliate the plant and there isn't a need for a spray to control them. If you see any beetles/caterpillars, you could pick them off by hand or tap them into a bucket of soapy water. The black substance you are seeing looks like it could be sooty mold as a result of sap sucking insects such as aphids that excrete 'honeydew'- a sticky substance that cause sooty mold to grow. You can just pick off that leaf. If you do notice aphids, Try just scraping them off or blasting them off with a strong stream of water from the hose. Usually that is enough to control their population and natural predators can keep the rest in check.  You can check out the following links for more information: https://extension.umd.edu/resource/aphids-vegetables https://extension.umd.edu/resource/growing-peppers-home-garden https://extension.umd.edu/resource/honeydew-and-sooty-mold Let us know if you have further questions.  Emily\nUser: You may have missed the second sentence stating not clear in pic is eating of the apical growth tips, so it will be having serious impact on production.  I've never had any issue in prior yrs, and there is no damage to surrounding tomato, cucs, kale, swiss chard, beans, and eggplant (except for flea beetles).  Given the selective damage, I thought there could be an obvious choice or 2.

I watered the grass in what I thought to be adequate to deal with our summer drought. I do not use much at all in the way of chemicals - pesticides, weed killer, fertilizer - trying to be chemical free.  Over the past 6-8 weeks, the lawn has been destroyed - it appears almost to have been plowed up.  It began as a few small \"holes\" about 2 inches wide and 1-2 inches deep, scattered around. Gradually progressed and now - There is literally no grass remaining. We do have ground hogs & opossums in the area, but I have not seen raccoons in a very long while.  From the photos attached, do you have any idea what might have caused this damage?  My flower beds, which are well-mulched, seem to have digging activity lately, also.  Thank you.\nExpert: Glenda, something has made a mess of your yard. Yard damage like this is caused by moles or voles or grubs. Moles dig tunnels just below the surface, leaving raised ridges and mounds of dirt (molehills). Their tunneling can uproot grass and disturb the lawn’s appearance. They are searching for earthworms, grubs, and other soil invertebrates. Voles create small surface tunnels that leave behind pathways or “runways” of dead grass. They chew on roots and bulbs, leading to dying patches in the lawn. They feed on vegetation, roots and seeds. Grubs (the larvae of beetles like Japanese beetles or chafer beetles) feed on grassroots, causing large brown patches that can be easily lifted because the roots are destroyed. Grubs are more likely to cause lawn damage in the spring and early summer.  From the photo it looks like there are tunnels and molehills in your yard which are characteristic signs of moles. So I suspect moles are causing the problem. Moles can be controlled using repellants, baits or traps. I am including a factsheet on moles which describes their activities and controls in more detail. Sometimes both moles and voles are present at the same time so I am also sending a factsheet on voles. Also with moles once they have exhausted their food supply in a yard they will move on. If you use a pesticide to control them please read and follow the directions on the label for effectiveness and safety.  It is probably too late in the year for traditional reseeding of your yard.  But there is a practice called dormant seeding (seeing over winter) which might be something for you to consider.  It gets the grass started sooner next spring.  Look over the factsheet and see if it might be a fit for you.  And one more factsheet on the best trufgrass types for Ohio (yeah we like factsheets). You can take the turfgrass sheet to a garden center to get a good seed mix for your area. Thank you for using Ask Extension. Moles Voles Dormant Deeding Turfgrass for Ohio\nUser: Thank you for this information. Thinking back - it seems like, in spite of my watering the grass during the drought, it died out anyway, & now I wonder if that was due to some insect that killed it from underneath. The damage I'm seeing is severe - as I mentioned, my little lawn appears to have been \"plowed up\" from underneath - I really don't like the idea of chemicals, but in addition to winter seeding, should I apply some type of pesticide to the area?  I don't want to harm wildlife or pollinators.  Also - whatever is causing all this problem is INVISIBLE!  I check the area during daytime & also after dark, & I've never seen a rodent or anything!  And - now in the bordering plant/flower beds which are mulched, I am seeing digging around.  Never experienced ANYTHING like this before! Thank you -"

I was reluctant to re-pot this houseplant because my daughter gave it to me in this pot as a gift on her wedding, 2 and a half years ago.  It is now quite leggy.  Should I replant in a bigger pot?  If/when I do that, should I sink it deeper in the soil?  Any advice would be appreciated.  Thank you!\nExpert: Hi there,  I don't have much expertise with houseplants, but I would be happy to do a little research. I am a little tied up today but should be able to get back to you tomorrow or Saturday.\nExpert: Hi again,  Another Master Gardener Volunteer saw your question and offered to answer it, since she has a lot of experience with houseplants. I'm going to send your question over to her, and she will be able to help you.\nExpert: Hello! Thank you for your question to AskExtension/Ask a Master Gardener. We are happy to answer your questions about house plants as well as yard and garden questions. You posed an excellent question, and the photos you included are very helpful. I think you will be happy with the information that follows!  The plant your daughter gifted you is commonly called an Arrowhead or Arrowhead Vine. It has other common names, American Evergreen, African Evergreen, Green Gold Naphthysis, and Trileaf Wonder, to name a few. (Its botanical name is Syngonium podophyllum, which is important to distinguish it from other “arrowhead” and similarly named plants.) Your plant looks to be in very good shape. It appears to be healthy and free of pests. You are taking excellent care; it must love the light in the location where it is growing, and it looks to have just the right amount of water. Keep up the great job! I can understand that you would like to keep the cute planter that is a treasured gift. It’s probable that you can grow an offspring of your plant in this planter. But I am getting ahead of myself! Read on! Your question asked if it was time to re-pot the plant. The short answer is \"probably yes\". This plant needs to be repotted every year or two for maximum growth and health. Do not, however, bury the plant deeper in soil. That wouldn’t be good for the plant and might even kill it. The “legginess” that you see is the vining growth pattern (called “habit”) that is normal for this plant. Syngonium podophyllum starts out as upright shoots with ovate or heart-shaped leaves and a bushy habit. As it matures the leaves become arrow shaped, and the plant habit becomes vining. You can provide a moss pole or trellis for the plant and “train” it to climb, or you can trim it back to maintain a more bush-like shape. Some people use Syngonium podophyllum in hanging baskets and allow it to vine. Here’s an excellent article from NC State Extension that gives great info about your plant. https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/syngonium-podophyllum/ When deciding whether to re-pot, check the roots of your plant to see if they are packed tightly into the pot (rootbound). If not, you can rejuvenate your plant by trimming it back. I am guessing, it is rootbound and will need to be re-potted. Use a container that is two inches in diameter wider and one to two inches deeper than your current container, but no larger. Use fresh, good quality potting soil. Here are a couple of articles about re-potting houseplants that you might find helpful:  https://extension.psu.edu/repotting-houseplants  https://extension.umn.edu/news/tips-repotting-houseplants https://wayne.ces.ncsu.edu/2022/04/repotting-houseplants/ It is super easy to propagate your Arrowhead to create new plants, which you can then re-pot into the container given to you by your daughter. (Be sure to clean container thoroughly and use fresh potting soil.) You can take cuttings and root in water or soil. Alternately, you can split your plant. Some articles with information on propagating Syngonium podophyllum :  https://www.uaex.uada.edu/yard-garden/resource-library/plant-week/arrowhead-philodendron.aspx https://marylandgrows.umd.edu/2017/11/20/make-more-plants-from-cuttings-5-plants-that-root-easily-in-water/ https://naes.agnt.unr.edu/PMS/Pubs/1998-3384.pdf I hope to have answered your question, but if you need clarification, or if the response has generated additional questions, please feel free to reply to this email. It will come directly to me, and I will be happy to reply. Best of luck to you with your Arrowhead!\nUser: Thank you, Charlie, for your thoughtful and detailed recommendations!  I so appreciate the time you spent on this!  I, too, thought that it was doing well, but knew that something needed to be done before it toppled over!I'll look at the links for re-potting a plant and will do that if it looks rootbound.  Otherwise, I'll trim it back as you suggested.If I have other questions, I'll let you know.  Thank you again!

To check if it is rootbound, gently remove the plant from its pot and inspect the roots. If they are tightly packed and circling the pot, it's time to repot. Choose a pot that is only slightly larger than the current one, about two inches wider in diameter and one to two inches deeper. Use fresh, high-quality potting soil. Do not plant it deeper than it currently is, as this could harm the plant. If the plant is not rootbound, you can trim it back to maintain its shape. Additionally, you can propagate new plants from cuttings and use the original pot for one of these new plants. This way, you can keep the sentimental value of the pot while ensuring your plant continues to thrive. Feel free to reach out if you have more questions or need further assistance!\"}"

This would apply to river birch. Remove the dead wood first and often, it is not necessary to remove any more wood. Then shape the tree as you wish.

River Birch trees can indeed be pruned and shaped, but it's important to do so correctly to avoid damaging the tree. The concern about killing branches when pruning is generally related to improper pruning techniques. When pruning, it's crucial to make clean cuts and avoid cutting too close to the trunk or main branches, which can damage the tree's ability to heal. It's also advisable to prune during the tree's dormant season, typically in late fall or winter, to minimize stress. If you are unsure about the correct technique, consulting with a certified arborist who has experience with River Birch trees can be beneficial. They can provide guidance specific to your trees' health and structure. I hope this helps clarify the situation!\"}"

Fine fescues, such as creeping red fescue, chewings fescue, or hard fescue, are often recommended for overseeding because they blend well with bluegrass and are more drought-tolerant. These fine fescues have a finer texture and are less likely to create the bunching appearance that tall fescue might. Additionally, they are more shade-tolerant and can handle moderate foot traffic, which is beneficial given your yard's usage by dogs and a child.

I have reported them to the DNR, been put on the map of locations found, and completed the worm ranger online module on the extension website.  Today I tested several areas using the mustard method to collect worms to see if I could get a better sense of population.  I really have only found 8-10 adult worms.  The smallest ones collected today are not identifiable due to their size.  I seem to be at the beginning of an infestation as I’ve been careful, and have been watching for these worms every year since learning about them.\n\nMy question is, since I seem to have a small amount of worms, what steps can I take now to keep them from becoming a huge problem?  I had planned to spread mulch, which I am now going to skip, should I try spreading the coconut mulch?  I read that can be a deterrent.  Are there any other steps I can take to limit the numbers now this year before they spread?  I’ve used alfalfa pellets in my gardens before as mulch/fertilizer-would it be worth purchasing bags of them and spreading as that was also listed as a deterrent.\n\nThe garden I’ve found them in is a dryer space under two large silver maples.  I have a mix of hosta, lungwort and a few other items in that space.  It is pretty shady so I don’t think applying plastic over the soil to heat it would work well. \n\nNot other spaces showed evidence of the worms.  I did talk to the neighbor on that side as my garden is against their fence and I know they have hosta on the other side… if they do nothing to limit numbers am I going to be fighting a losing battle?  He said he was aware of such a worm, and thinks he may have found one as well, but had convinced himself he was wrong.  I suspect he did find one.\n\nThanks for connecting me with someone who can provide direct advice.  I have read all the info online, I’m just looking for someone else with experience who can advise me.\n\nThanks."

Avoid spreading mulch that might harbor worm eggs; instead, coconut coir mulch can be a good alternative as it is less likely to contain worm eggs and may act as a deterrent. Alfalfa pellets can also be used as they break down and enrich the soil, potentially creating an unfavorable environment for the worms. Additionally, maintain good garden hygiene by removing plant debris and keeping the area clean to reduce potential habitats for the worms. Since your neighbor might also have jumping worms, it would be beneficial to collaborate with them to manage the problem collectively. Finally, stay informed about any new control methods or research developments regarding jumping worms, as this is an evolving area of study.\"}"

However, if the layer of leaves is too thick, it might smother the plants and prevent air circulation. In that case, you can gently remove some of the leaves by hand to ensure the ground cover isn't completely buried. Be careful not to disturb the roots of your newly planted cuttings. If you decide to rake, do so very gently to minimize the risk of damaging the plants.\"}"

An adjacent honeylocust tree, as well as a boulevard hackberry tree - both added later, have matured, making their site better suited to part-sun/shade plants.\n\nNo longer as interested in nor possessing enough yard space for herbs/vegetables, I would like to keep the metal rings where they are and in them install shade-tolerant perennials. The circular steel rings sit 1' above ground, are 38\" around, and have approximately 8\" of compost-enriched soil.  At this point in our Zone 4 growing season, I understand that perennials might not have adequate time to root and survive to return in spring. \n\nI'm reluctant to remove the rings and dig newer plants directly in the ground near the honeylocust for fear of disturbing the tree's roots. \n\nHowever, a local garden center currently has MN native plants (eg, columbine, short aster, sedge, figwort) and Zone 3-5 perennials (eg hosta, heuchera) at bargain prices ($2.50-$6) that I'm tempted to give that mixture a try in the raised beds.  \n\nIf it would be helpful for me to upload an image of the front yard w/steel rings, I can do so. \n\nThank you for your expert consideration!"

Be sure to clean all debris from the soil. Plant your garlic in a different location next year and protect the plants with row covers so the moths are not able to get to the plants.

Ensure you have proper lighting and protective clothing.\\n\\n3. **Insecticide**: Use a wasp spray that is designed to shoot a long distance, allowing you to treat the nest from a safe distance. Spray directly into the entrance of the nest.\\n\\n4. **Sealing**: After ensuring that the wasps are eradicated, you can seal the entry points with caulk. Make sure all wasps are dead or have left the area before sealing to avoid trapping live wasps inside.\\n\\n5. **Safety Precautions**: Wear protective clothing and ensure you have an escape route planned in case the wasps become aggressive.\\n\\n6. **Professional Help**: If the nest is large or you are uncomfortable handling it, consider contacting a pest control professional.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you should be able to safely and effectively deal with the wasps.

I'll attach an article with more information but basically you need to dormant spray in the winter and keep the leaves and prunings picked up when they drop.   There are no sprays recommended for home use, but you could try calling an arborist if the infection is severe this year. You can also cut out the twigs and leaves affected and dispose of them in the trash (not compost) if it is not too far advanced yet.   https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/pear-pyrus-spp-scab  Hope it's a light case,\nUser: I’m pretty surprised that after all these years with no problem that it’s popped up this year when we’ve had such a warm dry spring.  Does that make sense?On Jun 23, 2023, at 3:24 PM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

We know it can be very frustrating to have to answer more questions, but... it would be really helpful to have a bit more information as we work to figure out what is wrong with your lemon tree! A lot of very different problems can cause signs that look alike. How long have you had the tree? Have you had this problem in the past? Do you see any signs of insects on your tree, especially on the affected leaves? We can see a big insect on a healthy leaf in the image you sent, but we're wondering about little ones that feed by puncturing the leaves. Can you send us a photograph of the backside of one of the affected leaves?  If you could also send along an image of the whole tree that shows where the affected leaves are on the tree, that would be very helpful as well. Thank you very much! Deb K & Jennifer G\nUser: Hi all, Thanks for the response. No problem with questions!   We had this tree about ten years, never an issue before. Produces good limes.

(Please see the attached photo IMG_1790.)  Grass plants turning brown & dead only occurs in the lawn on that side of our house, and not on the other three sides.  It also doesn't seem to occur in the lawns of any of our neighbors.  The one thing present in our front lawn (and not present in the lawns on the other three sides of our house, nor in the lawns of our neighbors) is our Imperial Locust tree (the tree in the foreground of IMG_1790).  Is there something in the roots of the Imperial Locust, and/or in its leaves (which cover our front lawn in the fall until we rake them up) which kills grass plants?  The thick dark green grass adjacent to our Imperial Locust may seem to contradict that hypothesis.  But the healthy grass growing there may be misleading.  We planted that grass (from Scotts' grass seed) just a few years ago.  So whatever species of grass that was in that seed may be resistant to toxins from our Locust tree's roots or leaves.\n\nThirdly, since we had so much brown dead grass in our front yard this spring, the first fertilizer that I applied to our whole lawn this spring was not \"Scotts Turf Builder with HALTS Crabgrass Preventer\", but \"Scotts Turf Builder Green Max\".   The grass plants on the other three sides of our house (i.e. NOT the side with the Locust Tree) seemed to green up a little faster than normal.  However, we now have a problem with Black Medic(?) growing in the grass on all four sides of our home, which problem I've never seen in our lawn before.  (Please see the attached photo IMG_1915.)  (Maybe the \"Scotts Turf Builder with HALTS Crabgrass Preventer\" was preventing it from growing in prior years.)  My questions to you about this problem are:\na) Is that Black Medic?  If not, what is it?\nb) What herbicide (i..e. brand name) or herbicide ingredient (i.e. chemical compound) do you \n    recommend for killing that plant, but NOT killing the grass plants in our lawn?\n\nThank you for your answer to my first question (about what might be killing much of the grass in our front lawn every year) and for your best advice to my second set of questions (about the Black Medic[?] and how to kill it).\n\nGratefully yours,\nRoman\nExpert: I did not find any information that the Imperial Locust tree produces toxins from roots or leaves that are harmful to turf. I'd start by doing a soil test on your front lawn to learn more about your soil including soil type, pH, nutrient levels and more. Knowing the type and fertility of your soil is the starting point to establishing & maintaining a strong turf that can resist diseases, moss and insects/grubs and look great. More info here: Don't Guess-Soil Test-MSU and MSU Home Soil Test-self mailer You state that the lawn is dead when the snow melts in the spring.  This points to possible pink snow mold or grey snow mold as the problem.  No way to tell now as the evidence is gone. Here  are links to turf diseases and their prevention: MSU Turf disease ID  Purdue turf disease ID Turfgrass Disease Chart-OSU  I'd reseed the front yard (after getting a soil test) making sure to stop fertilizing after Oct 1.  The best time to reseed is Aug15-Sept 15 and earlier is better.  Raking the leaves up is a good idea too or mulch them into the turf.  More info on reseeding in the attached links: Establishing A New Lawn Using Seed (E2910)-MSU Renovating A Lawn for Quality & sustainability-UMN How to Overseed A Lawn-Iowa Lawn Renovation & Over-seeding-UMass Renovation of Lawns-PSU  Yes the weed isBlack Medic:  This weed can be suppressed or controlled with various postemergence herbicides, particularly those containing dicamba, MCPP, and/or fluroxypyr.  There are products at the local big box store.  I recommend spot spraying over a full lawn application.  Get it done quickly before the black medic goes to seed.  Next spring go back to the fertilizer with pre-emergent for additional control.

You also answered my first question, about whether Imperial Locust roots or leaves have toxins harmful to grass plants.  A while after your answer, however, I think that I may have figured out what is causing much of the grass in our front lawn to be dead by spring, and it's only indirectly related to Imperial Locust leaves.  I saw our problem (i.e. much of the grass in our front lawn being dead by spring) only in our front lawn (where we have that Imperial Locust tree), and in none of our other yards (which have no Imperial Locusts), and in none of our neighbors' yards (which also have no Imperial Locusts).  So, I assumed that this problem had something to do with that tree.  However, later this summer, I also noticed/remembered an area in our back yard which also had a lot of dead grass this past spring, and I realized what is common between that area, and our front lawn:  both of those areas were very strenuously raked the prior fall:- I strenuously raked our front yard last fall to try to pick up all of the Imperial Locust leaves' small leaflets;- I also strenuously raked that area in our back yard last fall to try to pick up the numerous leaves which had fallen & gathered there from our neighbor's back yard trees.So, maybe it's my strenuous raking which is killing the grass plants in those two areas.  I wanted to share this hypothesis with you in case anyone else ever contacts you with the same problem (areas of dead light-brown grass in the springtime, in a lawn where the other grass plants are just fine).Gratefully yours,Roman SkikunOn Sat, Jul 22, 2023 at 1:05 AM Roman Skikun <<personal data hidden>> wrote:Dear, Dakota:Thank you very much for the time & care that you took to provide me such detailed & helpful answers to my questions.  I greatly appreciate it.Gratefully yours,Roman SkikunNovi, MIOn Wed, Jul 19, 2023 at 8:45 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: Thank you for your follow-up comment on heavy raking your lawn.  I will keep it in mind as I answer future AE questions.

The trunk of the tree had broken curling layer (bark). I thought it was anthracnose. I added some slow release nitrogen to the soil about 10 days ago as the leaves were starting to come out. About 4 days ago, I noticed that some of the leaves at the ends were turning black, curling  and drying up. Do I have one problem or two? See attached pictures.\nExpert: Hi, Jamie, I have a few questions about the tree's location. Where is the tree growing? When you planted it, did you amend the soil? Is the soil wet or dry?  If the roots were too dry or too wet this spring, roots may be negatively impacted, causing the leaves at the tip to curl up and turn brown. This is called leaf scorch.  https://mortonarb.org/plant-and-protect/tree-plant-care/plant-care-resources/leaf-scorch/ The condition of the bark may or may not be related to the leaf scorch. The image you posted was a bit fuzzy. Hoping you can attach another picture of the stem/bark? And answer a couple of questions. Do you see any holes in the trunk - especially around where the bark peeled off? Is the area under the peeled bark discolored? Even spotty discolored?  The answers to those questions will help me try to figure out what could be happening to the tree.  Please stay in touch.  Thank you! -Julie\nUser: I live on a dirt road and this is in a sunny location with full sun. The soil is a sandy loam which I did not amend when I planted (I grew this from a seed/nut started in the fall of 2018). Last fall I noticed that the leaves and some of the branches had turned yellow and had brown spots…this is why I thought it had anthracnose and why I treated with slow release nitrogen this spring.  I have been watering it about 2x a week (2+ gallons each time) for about the last 3 weeks (since a little after out last rain). I hope this helps … it looks much better now  but still has those black curled leaves.

The yellowing leaves with brown spots could indeed be a sign of anthracnose, which is common in walnut trees. The black, curling leaves might be a result of leaf scorch, possibly exacerbated by recent frost damage, as you mentioned it is on the east/southeast side of the trunk. The broken, curling bark could be related to environmental stress or frost damage as well. \\n\\nTo address these issues, continue monitoring the tree's water needs, ensuring it is neither too dry nor too wet. Since the tree is in sandy loam, it should drain well, but keep an eye on moisture levels. You might also consider applying a fungicide if anthracnose is a recurring problem, but ensure it is suitable for use on walnut trees. Additionally, protect the tree from future frost damage by using tree wraps or other protective measures during cold snaps. Regularly inspect the tree for any signs of pests or further damage to the bark. With proper care, your tree should continue to improve. If you notice any new symptoms or if the condition worsens, consider consulting a local arborist for a more detailed assessment.\"}"

I have been gardening for quite a while and have found that kitchen gardening is the most difficult of all. To grow an edible plant with an annual is a unique challenge. Little annual flowers are much easier.  And one has several seasons to work on perennials.  But to go from seed to 3 pound squash in one summer is quite a trick.  The only general advice I have is read carefully on how to grow each crop.  Soil, fertilizer (not too much or all you get is leaves), water, mounding, trellises etc.  Best to you.\nUser: Thanks.

Look for products containing active ingredients like potassium bicarbonate or neem oil, which are often effective against powdery mildew.\\n\\n2. **Improve Air Circulation**: Ensure that your plants are not too densely planted, as this can hinder air circulation and promote mildew growth. If possible, thin out some plants to allow better airflow.\\n\\n3. **Soil Amendment**: For future planting, consider amending your sandy soil with organic matter such as compost or well-rotted manure to improve its water retention and nutrient content. This will help create a more favorable growing environment for your squash.\\n\\n4. **Preventive Measures**: Consider using a UV screen cloth to protect plants from sunscald and reduce stress, which can make them more susceptible to diseases.\\n\\n5. **Monitor and Rotate**: Continue to monitor your plants closely and practice crop rotation to prevent the buildup of soil-borne diseases.\\n\\nThese steps should help manage the current mildew problem and improve conditions for future growing seasons.\"}"

Thank you.\nExpert: Thank you for your question.  Is there a way you could cut a piece of the vine off and send in photos that clearly show the leaves/vine?\nUser: Thank you for your response. Attached are some pics of the leaves. The vines transverse along (right at or just below) the ground and climb to the top of anything they can find.

(#0102450)\nExpert: Thank you for sending those images.  The first image has the characteristics of a Wisteria vine. However, it is hard to know if it is the American or Chinese variety without seeing the seed pods. Chinese wisterias have fuzzy seed pods and are an aggressive viner, while North American wisteria has smooth seed pods and the vines tend to be bushier. Also, the flowers on the North American varieties bloom after the plant has leafed out, while Chinese wisterias will bloom before the foliage opens.  Species Spotlight: Wisteria | Lower Hudson Partnership for Regional Invasive Species Management. (lhprism.org) The second and third images are a trumpet creeper. The fresh young growth in spring is often damaged by late frosts. Plants can spread somewhat aggressively, particularly in rich, fertile soils, by suckering from underground runners. Campsis grandiflora (Chinese Trumpet Creeper, Trumpet Creeper, Trumpet Vine) | North Carolina Extension Gardener Plant Toolbox (ncsu.edu) The non-chemical strategy that works or larger vines/small shrubs/woody plants is to cut the trunk, and then keep an eye on the stump over the next several years. Every time it sends up a shoot, prune it off. This strategy basically involves starving the plant to death: it costs the plant energy to send up each shoot, and if you cut off the shoot before the new leaves can start feeding new energy into the plant, the plant loses. But if you forget it, and allow new leaves to recharge the plant's resources, the plant wins, and you lose, and the clock starts over. Triclopyr (the active ingredient in Ortho Poison Ivy and Tough Brush Killer, among others) is the best herbicide for persistent woody vines. The best method of treatment is to cut the vine and treat the cut surface (in 5 minutes or less) with the concentrated herbicide. The same is true for treatments with glyphosate. In the case of both of these products you need to purchase the concentrate (~8% triclopyr or 40% glyphosate) and not the ready-to-use product (0.7% triclopyr or 1-2% glyphosate).  When using any herbicide--or any garden chemical, even those marked \"organic\"-- ALWAYS READ AND FOLLOW THE LABEL INSTRUCTIONS AND WARNINGS. In addition, note that herbicides should NOT be used when air temperatures exceed 85 degrees, or will exceed that temperature in the next 8 or 12 hours. In hot weather, herbicides can evaporate and form a small toxic cloud that can drift for hundreds of feet.\nUser: Thank you so much for that information.

Our Pondarosas at about 8,000 feet are being killed by a grub or insect that chews vertical channels in the trunk wood at about two feet from the ground. The tree eventually dies and falls over at the weakened point. The channels are visible in the break. We've now lost 7 trees to this little devil. One of your experts gave me the name of the bug and recommended a treatment liquid to use. If you can give me the name of the bug again, I can get more of the liquid by checking the label. I believe it's made by Bayer. My second question is about when to treat the healthy trees. I know that early spring is best, but because water is unavailable on the property between late May and mid September, I would like to know if there is an alternative time when we have water but won't endanger birds or squirrels. Many many thanks, Lucy Graca (<personal data hidden>)\nExpert: Hi, Reese,  I found your question and the publication that was referenced: https://csfs.colostate.edu/franktown/fr-insects-diseases/  But the answer didn't identify the actual insect - it's likely a type of wood borer. Without more information or photos, I don't feel comfortable offering recommendations.  What city are you located? If you're in Estes Park, you can contact Brian Berg: <personal data hidden>  If you're elsewhere (i.e. Red Feather Lakes), you can contact the Colorado Forest Service: https://csfs.colostate.edu/fort-collins/\nUser: Thank you so much for your swift reply, Dr. O’Connor. I’ve copied Brian Berg because the trees are at our cabin in Estes Park. We have now lost at least 7 very large trees to this disease or pest over the last two or three years.I’ve not only lost the answer to my question, but also all the photos I took. But maybe I can describe the infestation. The tree falls over, usually in a high wind, with the trunk broken about two to three feet from the ground. The exposed trunk wood is broken in spikes, spongy and riddled with holes (or maybe “galleries”?). The tree dies from the top down over two or three years. We are very familiar with pine beetles — this isn’t them — no blue staining.  I’m desperately trying to save our remaining trees. I believe I was told to apply Bayer Tree and Shrub protect and feed, but I was also told to read the label and check that the responsible insect was listed — but now of course I can’t remember that insect’s name. The Web isn’t being any help. If that is still not enough info, I will take new photos next time I’m at the cabin and send them along. But my other question, about applying the Bayer stuff between the end of May and middle of September is my main concern. That is the only time that we have enough water to apply it correctly.  Many thanks for your patience, Lucy Graca   On Jul 3, 2024, at 3:18 PM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: Hi, Reese,  Are the trees dead before they break? If so, something is causing them to die - but it may not be the borer. There are a lot of secondary pests that go into dead or dying trees. Many longhorn beetles do this, as well as other bark beetles/borers.   If these trees aren't regularly maintained - they could be experiencing drought or other environmental stressors. We have seen many trees that are lost because of weather, temperature swings, lack of water, etc.  The product you're thinking of would have imidacloprid, but these products were pulled from shelves due to a change in legislature. They are no longer available to homeowners - or won't be in the future. As for timing, it would depend on WHAT insect (if any) you're trying to treat. I couldn't offer recommendations without knowing exactly what's caused the trees to die and if it is insects or something else.  Perhaps Brian can offer more guidance to you - since he works in Estes, this may be a more familiar problem to him.\nUser: Thanks for your help.

I'm wondering if we should be concerned and need to intervene in any way, or if you think the problem will resolve itself. There are kids who come to the garden and I don't know if they will spread rapidly. Do you think if we replace the wood, should that wood be treated or untreated or does it not matter.

To manage it, you should prune out the affected branches at least 8-12 inches below the visible symptoms, making sure to disinfect your pruning tools between cuts to prevent spreading the bacteria. It's best to prune during dry weather to minimize the risk of spreading the disease. Additionally, avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can promote susceptible new growth.

This is harder than it sounds. I will explain why below.  Apples: Without some type of documentation from the purchaser of the fruit trees, it is very difficult to identify a specific fruit cultivar, especially for apples because there are so many types. Sometimes you can narrow down the possibilities to a short-list of potential cultivars based on the color, texture, appearance, time of ripening, age, and size of the tree and then use an on-line apple data base. Other suggestions: bring apple samples to an orchard-based Apple Day event. The most specific way is to use a genetic testing service that uses DNA fingerprinting to identify specific cultivars, but this may be more than you are interested in. See the following reference https://yardandgarden.extension.iastate.edu/faq/how-can-i-identify-apple-tree-variety-my-backyardPeaches: Reliance and Contender are two peach varieties that do well in VT. You probably have one of these cultivars. Once the peaches are ripe, you can compare photos and determine which you are likely to have.  Pears: Again many cultivars. Knowing the possibilities for your planting region could help. Do you know what Plant Hardiness Zone you are in-  Zone 4 or 5? You can check on this map https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov You may be able to call around to find a fruit tree nursery that would be willing to look at your photos and fruit samples to help with ID.  I will also reach out to my collaborators to see if they are aware of anyone who helps with fruit identification at UVM. I will reach back out if I have further info and feel free to write again if you have more questions.\nUser: Hi, Jordan you for your answers. I suspected as much, so it will be a wait and see game. Based on the map, my guess is we are in zone 5A.

One common approach is to apply elemental sulfur to the soil, which gradually lowers the pH over time. The amount needed will depend on your current soil pH and the desired pH level, so it's important to follow the instructions on the product label. Another option is to use acidifying fertilizers, such as ammonium sulfate, which can help lower the pH while providing nutrients. Additionally, incorporating organic matter like peat moss can also help acidify the soil. It's important to monitor the soil pH regularly to ensure it reaches and maintains the desired acidity level for optimal blueberry growth.\"}"

Read about Fletcher Scale here: https://extension.psu.edu/fletcher-scale Certainly, there is serious dieback of the branch. With a picture of the whole tree, a better assessment can be made. MSU Extension’s Plant and Pest Diagnostic Lab can provide a complete diagnosis and treatment of the problem.

Thank you for contacting Ask Extension.\nUser: The brown \"lumps\" at the end of each dying branch are what I thought were Fletcher Scale.  However, in all the online pictures, the Fletcher Scale appears on the middle of the branches, rather than at the very ends, so maybe it's something else.  The arborvitae this was taken from is mostly dead with just a few live branches near the top.  I can certainly bring in the entire bush for identification if that helps.

Others in the same garden are fine.  In one garden where the leaves are discolored the plants growth seems to be stunted but not in others.\nExpert: Dear, Avery, Thank you for reaching out to the UVM Extension Master Gardener Program with your question. Nutritional deficiency can cause yellowing of the leaves. As it sounds like the affected plants are near healthy phlox plants I would think nutritional deficiency is not the issue. Feeding by aphids can result in yellow, curled or stunted leaves, but I would have expected you to see the aphids on your plants. Spider mites are a common problem for phlox. Their feeding on the leaves usually causes a stippling on the leaves but over time can progress to yellowing of the leaves. Spider mites are tiny so you need to use a hand lens to look for them on the underside of the leaves. Webbing on the underside of the leaves is another clue that you are dealing with a spider mite problem. My biggest concern is that the findings in your phlox plants may be from Aster Yellows, which is a plant disease caused by a phytoplasma (bacteria like organism) that is transmitted by the leafhopper insect. Infection with Aster Yellows manifests as yellowing of the leaves and stems, stunted growth and malformed flowers. When the insect feeds on an infected plant it takes in the bacteria and then can transmit the bacteria to the next plant when the leafhopper feeds. Many different type of plants can be infected with Aster Yellows. Once infected a plant will not recover and needs to be removed from your landscape and destroyed to prevent further spread.  You should inspect the undersides of the leaves carefully using a hand lens to look for evidence of spider mites. Recommending removal and destruction of plants is serious so I want to be sure that that is the necessary course of action. Additional photos may be helpful. I am including our plant pathologist in my response.  The resources below provide more information. https://extension.umn.edu/plant-diseases/aster-yellows https://extension.umn.edu/flowers/tall-garden-phlox\nUser: Thank you for all the information. When I went looking for bugs, I found slugs and this little bug. It looks more like some sort of beetle, but I’m not sure I sent additional pictures as suggested. You’ll see one picture of a phlox that’s dying. There are a number of the little ones dying whose growth was stunted.Thank you for any additional info you can deem from these photos.Sent from my iPhoneSent from my iPhone On Jul 4, 2024, at 11:29 PM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:   ﻿\nExpert: Dear, Charlie, Thank you for providing additional photos. I cannot see the underside of the leaves in any of the photos. I was not able to zoom in on the photos for greater detail. Although you saw the one beetle and some slugs on your plants I do not think that those are playing a major role in your phlox problem. In the photo showing the top of a plant that is wilted with browning of the leaves, there appears to be webbing and tiny white structures. I could not zoom in for finer detail but I wondered if the white “spots” were aphids. The webbing suggests spider mites. The phlox in the second photo appears to be very close to a cement wall. In the following photo both of the plants have the same yellowing pattern to the leaves and it is notable that all of leaves over the entire length of the plant are involved. That pattern suggests a more systemic process. You didn’t mention the plant location. Phlox like full sun and you can see yellowing of leaves if the plants are not getting adequate sunlight. The fact that the one photo shows the plant in front of a cement wall raises the issue of adequate sunlight. Phlox like moist, well-drained soil. Too much water could contribute to yellowing of leaves. As mentioned previously, nutritional deficiency can also result in yellowing of the leaves. You did not mention if you have fertilized the plants. The best way to look for nutritional deficiency is by doing a soil test.  I am still concerned that you could be dealing with Aster Yellows as the pathogen lives within the vascular system of the plant and spreads through the entire plant from roots to flowers. The Aster Yellows pathogen can affect plant growth, development, and ability to process nutrients. As the pathogen can be spread from plant to plant by the leafhopper it would be important to make this diagnosis and remove the infected plants to prevent further spread.  I have included our plant pathologist as collaborator on my response. She may provide additional information and suggestions such as submitting plant material to the lab for further investigation. See resources below that provide additional information to the resources included in my prior answer: https://apps.extension.umn.edu/garden/diagnose/plant/annualperennial/phlox/leavesdiscolored.html https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/help-for-the-home-gardener/advice-tips-resources/insects-pests-and-problems/insects/plant-bugs/phlox-bugs https://www.uvm.edu/extension/agricultural-and-environmental-testing-lab\nUser: Thank you for our ongoing discussion. All my phlox are getting full sun.  The soil in these beds drains well and appears to be moist but not saturated. I am an amateur gardener and have never fertilized my gardens in the 45 years I have had gardens. And my gardens have always been beautiful! Dumb luck I guess! I could not find any bugs on the phlox.  I am sending more pictures that may or may not be helpful.                      I should also mention that since we started this conversation the healthy green phlox that were next to these phlox are now turning yellow so that entire bed is now the entire bed is affected. I don’t think that’s a good sign. I hope these pictures are more helpful in seeing the underside of the plants.  Again thank you for your help.

Since the phlox are in full sun and the soil conditions are good, the yellowing and stunted growth could be due to a lack of nutrients, especially since the garden has not been fertilized in many years. I recommend conducting a soil test to determine if there are any nutrient deficiencies. This will help in deciding if fertilization is needed and what type of fertilizer would be most beneficial. Additionally, keep an eye on the plants for any signs of pests or diseases that might have been missed. If the soil test indicates a deficiency, applying a balanced fertilizer could help improve the health of your phlox.

I utilized chip drop every year. But since moving to Colton Or, I’ve been on Chip drops list, PGEs list and reached out to an arborist, for the past 3 years I’ve had no luck finding a resource. I’ve offered money for their time but I’ve sadly gotten no interest in a drop in my location. \n\nI would love any resources you may have access too. Naturally cut up branches, trees etc are so much better then what you can buy at the nurseries or I’d happily go that route but playground chips just don’t break down the same. We are so desperate in our community for a resource, unfortunately I’m not the only one and any info you can give me I’d be sharing with my whole small town of passionate gardeners. \n\nThank you for your time.\nExpert: As you probably know, there are a variety of commercial landscape supply companies who will deliver truckloads of various kinds of bark mulch, hog fuel, or wood chips. Of course those can be costly. Various arborists and tree services are looking for places to drop chips from time to time, but it sounds like you have tried that.  Coincidentally, I learned today of a landowner out of Estacada who has a large pile of chips (>200 cubic yards) from a forest fuels reduction project - some are new some are composted. They would be probably be happy to see some of these get hauled away, but you would have to arrange for the loading and hauling. Otherwise, they will probably just spread them out in the forest.\nUser: Thank you so much for the lead.

This past spring it flowered like normal, but after losing its flowers, its now starting to lose its leaves as you can see. The bark has seem to come back nicely.  Is it due to the rabbits or is there a blight/disease?  Is there something I can do or is it just \"time will tell\" and let nature take its course?  Would it make sense to call an arborist or tree company to look at it?  If so do you have any recommendations?  Thank you!\nExpert: Thank you for writing. I need a close up of the out side a twig where the leaves are dying, not dead.  Then, I would like you to cut that branch where it is about 1/2 inch in diameter and send me two pics, one the cross-section where you cut the branch and the other of the bark near the cut. https://apps.extension.umn.edu/garden/diagnose/plant/deciduous/crabapple/branchdieback.html I would guess botyris but I need more information.\nUser: Hi, Jordan,  Here are the pics you requested.

Blob is hard to the touch, but has a slightly sticky surface.  Is this normal or something I need to take care of?  If so, what is your recommended remedy?  Pictures attached.\nExpert: Oh no! This isn't looking good!   I'm seeing signs of a disease called bacterial canker. You can read more about it in OSU's PNW Pest Management Handbook. The globs of sap are one sign. Look closely. You'll also see dieback of the twigs and flowers plus some signs of cracking in the bark.   How long ago did you plant this tree? If it was this spring you may want to contact the nursery to see about a possible replacement.\nUser: Wow!  Not what I expected.  Is the canker mostly transmitted through the ground and roots system, or through  the air?  The handbook doesn't paint a glowing picture of recovery, so is it better to spray and wait or remove?  Will the canker spread to other non-plum trees?  The trees are in their third year, grafted on a plum rootstock..  Hate to get rid of the tree, but may have to look for a different graft.

Since your tree is already in its third year, replacing it might be a difficult decision, but it could be necessary if the infection is severe. If you choose to try and manage the disease, continue with copper sprays during the dormant season and ensure good sanitation practices, such as sterilizing pruning tools and removing any infected plant material.

Since you've already planted other desirable plants, using herbicides can be tricky as they might harm your existing plants. Here are some steps you can take:\\n\\n1. **Manual Removal**: Continue to cut back the horsetail as soon as it appears. This will weaken the plant over time by depleting its energy reserves.\\n\\n2. **Mulching**: Apply a thick layer of mulch to suppress the growth of horsetail. This can help reduce the light reaching the soil and slow down its growth.\\n\\n3. **Soil Improvement**: Horsetail thrives in poor, compacted, and wet soils. Improving soil drainage and fertility can make the environment less favorable for horsetail. Consider aerating the soil and adding organic matter to improve its structure.\\n\\n4. **Barrier Methods**: If possible, install a physical barrier underground to prevent the spread of horsetail rhizomes into the area.\\n\\n5. **Herbicide Use**: If you decide to use herbicides, look for those specifically labeled for horsetail and apply them carefully to avoid contact with your other plants.

Here are some steps you can recommend to your neighbor:\\n\\n1. **Cultural Control**: Encourage healthy lawn growth by mowing at the correct height (usually 2.5 to 3 inches for most grasses), watering deeply but infrequently, and overseeding with desirable grass species to outcompete crabgrass.\\n\\n2. **Mechanical Control**: Hand-pull or use a weeding tool to remove crabgrass plants before they set seed. This is most effective when the soil is moist.\\n\\n3. **Chemical Control**: Apply a pre-emergent herbicide in early spring before crabgrass seeds germinate. If crabgrass is already present, a post-emergent herbicide can be used, but it should be applied when the plants are young and actively growing.\\n\\n4. **Prevention**: Maintain a thick, healthy lawn to prevent crabgrass seeds from germinating. Regular lawn care practices such as aeration and proper fertilization can help.\\n\\nSince you mentioned not fertilizing your lawn, consider a balanced fertilization program to promote healthy grass growth, which can naturally suppress crabgrass. Always follow label instructions when using herbicides and consider consulting a local extension service for specific recommendations tailored to your region.\"}"

About a third are vertically striped (neoregelia?) of which half  have the splotches showing in attached pics.  Is this a fungus which could be controlled or should be tossed, or is it genetic so no hope to irridicate?  Thanks.\nExpert: We're not certain what the cause of damage is, but suspect growing conditions instead of issues of pest or disease outbreaks. Have any chilly drafts hit the plants, and does the growing area get good air circulation? (Are the plants misted, or only watered in the \"tank\"/cup of the plant? Misting foliage might allow for easier infection by pathogens until the leaf surface dries.) Has any spray (pesticide or otherwise) been used on or near the plants before this damage appeared? Were any updates to grow lights made, where the light intensity output has increased? (Or are the plants in a greenhouse?)  We don't have extensive bromeliad experience as they are not as commonly grown here, so we may need to reach out to other Extension resources or experienced tropical plant experts outside of Maryland to see if they recognize the cause. (In that case, we can also share with them the information you provide us regarding the questions above, and hope to have some feedback during next week.)  Miri\nUser: Really appreciate your effort.  I was hoping it is a common issue for the genus that someone would recognize.  I should have mentioned that it is not on every leaf of a plant (usually 20-33%), it is mainly visible on top side, and it is in the tissue not raised.  Let's eliminate some issues by responding to your questions.1. This variety is in one room facing east on shelves 12-18\" from double pane windows, with reasonable space and no artificial light. 2. There is water in cup and I water the loose mix soil once or twice a week.  I mist irregulariy but never when there is sun (in morning).3. No pesticides or other sprays have been used.Hope this helps.On Fri, Mar 17, 2023 at 11:48 AM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nUser: I forgot that there is also recent presence on this Vriesea Splendens.\nExpert: Thank you for the additional information and image. We'll see what we can find out via consultations and will get back to you as soon as we have feedback.  Window-only light from an eastern exposure is potentially insufficient for long-term health and vigor of the plants in general, even if not necessarily responsible for this issue.  A southern- or western-facing window usually receives more intense light, but even then might not be enough overall. Bromeliads like these prefer much more intense light (not full sun per se, but quite bright relative to typical indoor light levels). Supplementing their light with a grow light source might be useful going forward. Or, if you have the outdoor space, growing them outside in part shade in summer (from about late May through early October, potentially) can help them receive the light they prefer and \"stockpile\" carbohydrates to help carry them through the leaner times of winter indoors.  Have you observed any armored scale or thrips on any other plants in that area? Scale are perhaps the most common insect pest on bromeliads, though in our experience they tend not to cause damage this widespread. (Thrips might, as may certain types of mite.) The linked pages don't pertain exactly to the particular scale and thrips species that might be attacking tropical plants indoors, but still contain general information about each that might be useful for inspecting the plants. We don't see either pest in the photos, but they are small and might be easy to miss, especially if a mobile pest like thrips wasn't roaming around the damaged leaf portions at the time. (Scale adhere to the leaf and don't move.)  Have the plants been fertilized since prior to the symptoms manifesting? If so, is the fertilizer used one formulated for air plants (epiphytes like Tillandsia or orchids, often) or a general houseplant formulation? You've been growing the plants for so long that we presume no drastic changes in your care for them will be a factor, but we're trying to cover all the bases. When was the last time the potting mix was refreshed (at least on the symptomatic plants), in case old fertilizer \"salt\" residues have built up in the substrate? Is a household water softener used by any chance, where that water source is used to water the plants?  Miri\nUser: The room has a wall of 4 windows together, each 32w x 70h, and the plant shelves are at the middle 2 with nothing including drapes obstructing light from the 2 at ends.   Therefore, they are getting more light than you probably assumed. I am familiar with those insects, and others, but there has been no sign of any in the 8 yrs of growing there.No water softener.  I draw water at least several days in advance to allow chemical evaporation and reaching room temp.  Fert is once a mo with half (or less) strength liquid rotating between organic and chemical.  I don't see any salts on pot or soil, but I don't repot, except bviously when the old plant dies back I start the pups in new mix which is combo of potting soil and bark.Thanks for your willingness to stick with this.On Fri, Mar 17, 2023 at 2:04 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: Thank you for your patience as we've waiting to get additional feedback. Unfortunately the consultations we were trying to reach haven't come through for us yet, we think because there is a conference the people are attending and less accessible via email. Our in-house plant pathologist is still fairly certain these are abiotic symptoms (that is, not caused by pest or disease but instead by environmental conditions), but isn't sure what exact factors triggered the damage. Based on the leaf patterns he thinks maybe something happened while those particular leaves were still expanding, but we're not certain.  To answer your original question, we don't think it's likely the plants would need to be discarded and they will probably grow out of the damage gradually, in that forthcoming new leaves would emerge normally unless the environmental stressors repeated themselves.  Would you like us to try to reach out to someone in Extension down in Florida, perhaps? (Our thinking is that since lots of these types of tropicals are grown more widely there, both as landscaping plants and for shipping to nurseries in other states, that maybe they'll have more experience and recognize these symptoms.)  Miri\nUser: Truly appreciate your extra effort.  Since this is not an urgent matter, it seems appropriate to wait for your orig contacts to respond.  If after a month there has been no response, then contacting Florida would be much appreciated.  Let's tickle for 5/1.  Thanks.

You didn’t include a photo so it is difficult to tell what is going on.  You say the wilting is on one side - the Sidney side. If the plant was good one day and starting to wilt the next day, that sounds like herbicide drift.  Has anyone been spraying an herbicide nearby? https://extension.umn.edu/yard-and-garden-news/noticing-herbicide-drift-your-garden The best reaction to this is to just continue to water adequately to help them recover. Don’t over water or fertilize.\nUser: Thank you for your prompt reply. There has not been any spraying. The farms are organic. I felt that too much exposure to wind, sun and heat were the cause as we did have stronger than normal winds for two days. I apologize for not including that information as I was trying to be brief. I have provided wind and sun protection and the plant remains unchanged. Not worse and not better so maybe that's a good thing. Do panicle hydrangeas need protection from wind?  Thank you.\nExpert: You haven't said how long this hydrangea has been in the ground but I can say that it takes them years to develop a deep root system to withstand drought.  Protecting it from the wind and sun is good as we are in the 3rd year of a drought. Sun and wind both contributing to more drying of foliage. Hopefully, this will help. My own experience was that my hydrangea was my water monitor.\nUser: Thank you again for your reply.  2nd season. So we planted it last year. I am considering getting a soil moisture monitor. I think I need to be more diligent about adding protection when hot and windy. How much water and frequency do you think?

Watering deeply once or twice a week should suffice, but adjust based on the moisture readings from your monitor.

        "value": "User: Hi, Taylor have an established 40 ft. boxwood hedge that is suddenly yellowing.  They looked great all summer but last week we noticed they were yellowing.  Any thoughts or suggestions?  We live in Franklin, MI.\n\nThanks, and GO Green!\nExpert: In the absence of any photographs, I can only offer the most likely reasons for you Boxwood plants turning yellow. Yellowing leaves do not necessarily signal that your shrub is dead. But they are concerning because they mar the appearance, at least temporarily, of a plant valued for the beauty of its delicate, leathery, rich green foliage.  The good news is that there is usually a way to fix the problem of boxwood turning yellow. Following are some of the reasons boxwoods turn yellow and suggestions for how to fix it. The fix is different for each, so it's important to detect the reason in your particular case. Once you have fixed the underlying problem that caused their foliage to yellow, then all you can do is wait for them to green up again.  Fungal DiseasesRoot rot and boxwood blight are fungal diseases that attack boxwood. Root rot is caused by fungal pathogens in the soil. As with all fungal problems, it is most prevalent where the soil is overly wet.  To avoid having your boxwoods turn yellow due to root rot (or to keep the problem from getting any worse), make sure: --- You don't overwater, and--- The soil drains well. Boxwoods often harbor boxwood blight when they are being grown at the nursery. When you bring your plants home, you can accidentally spread them by shearing your shrubs in wet weather. This transports the disease from plant to plant. When you shear boxwoods, frequently disinfect your shearing tools with a disinfectant such as bleach to prevent spreading the disease. Shear them only on dry days.  Winter DamageAlthough this is unlikely in our case because you mention that they looked great all summer, it is possible for boxwood leaves to turn a coppery or yellowish color during a Northern winter. This is caused by exposure to wind and sun, which dry the plant out at a time when, due to the frozen ground, water is not readily available to it.  To prevent this \"winter burn,\" spray an anti-desiccant on your boxwood in late November and again in late January. Alternatively, wrap your boxwood in burlap. Salt Damage This condition is also unlikely, as you report that your plants looked great all summer and it is not yet winter. However, you do not mention exactly where your boxwoods are planted, so the following may be helpful information to not. If your boxwoods are planted along the road, they could suffer salt damage during the winter in the North. You'll notice yellowing leaves come spring. When the salt gets on the leaves, it can dry them out. The salt can also get into the soil, keeping your shrubs from absorbing water properly.  Covering your plants isn't sufficient in this case since you wouldn't be able to keep the salt from getting into the soil. The only fix here is to choose a different planting location for your boxwoods. Alternatively, grow salt-tolerant plants along the road.  Dog UrineAnother cause of boxwoods turning yellow is stray dogs urinating on them. This happens because urine contains excessively high concentrations of nitrogen. Use repellents to keep stray dogs out of your yard. PestsBoxwoods are attacked by pests such as leaf miners and scale. Serious infestations can result in boxwoods turning yellow. Faithfully inspect your plants for pests, particularly the undersides of the leaves. If you find any pest activity, the articles at the close of this response will provide information about what to so. TipPerform \"the scrape test\" to see if your boxwood is dead. With a sharp knife, scrape off a bit of the bark on one of the branches. If what you see underneath is yellowish-green, that branch is alive; if brown, it's dead. Repeat on all the branches with yellow leaves. Prune out the branches you've determined to be dead. If you've pruned out the vast majority of the branches, it's probably time to replace the plant. More Tips about Growing Health Boxwoods:Despite all the various factors that can cause your boxwood's leaves to turn yellow, boxwood is not an especially hard plant to grow. Nor is it high maintenance unless you will be trimming it in a hedge. Here are a few tips to follow to keep your boxwoods healthy: --- Boxwoods are best planted in full sun in the North, partial shade in the South.--- Give your shrub a loamy soil that drains well.--- Locate it where it will be sheltered from winds.--- Boxwood roots are shallow, which can expose them to excessive heat. Put a layer of organic garden mulch, 3 inches thick, around your plant to give it protection from the heat.

        "value": "User: Hello, Taylor have a Japanese Cherry Blossom tree that has fairly significant leaf damage from insects. We planted the tree 2 years ago and have been using a product such as Sevin to try to control it with ou much luck. We really don't see any insects on the tree. Can you tell what might be causing this and the best way to treat it? The tree seems otherwise healthy.\nExpert: Hello and thank you for your question. Would you be able to provide a few pictures of the tree (whole tree and some affected leaves) so our experts can better assist you? If you are unable to upload photos here, you can send them to me via email at <personal data hidden>.  Sincerely,\nExpert: Attaching pictures now. Will assign to an expert for review shortly.\nExpert: Hi, Riley, Thank you for your inquiry and pictures. The leaves of your ornamental cherry tree have definitely been munched on by insects! The chunks from the outer edges of the leaves look like caterpillar chewing (such as spongy moth larva); the smaller interior holes could have come from any number of different sucking insects. When looking for insects, did you inspect the undersides of the leaves? Some insects such as aphids and thrips will hide out there.   Using Sevin should have killed most sucking insects (but not caterpillars). It would be quite difficult to reach the top of a tree this tall without proper equipment, so perhaps you were not getting good coverage or the Sevin was applied at the wrong time. The good news is that the canopy of your tree still looks healthy enough to feed it for the remainder of this season. The damage to your leaves should not be a serious concern.  I do see a couple of other things that might be impacting the overall health of your tree. First, what is at the base of your tree that looks like dead grass? If that is what it is, why did it die? If perhaps a grass killer or other herbicide was used there, your tree was also adversely affected by the chemicals. The best way to keep your tree healthy is to manually remove all grass and other plant material from around the base about 3-4 feet in diameter and apply a 2-3\" layer of mulch there. Keep the mulch at lease 2-3\" away from the trunk of the tree as that will cause the area to retain water and hence trunk rot can occur, giving insects and diseases an area of entrance into the tree.   Another potential problem is what appears to be a wound or hole in the trunk near the base of the tree that could be caused by gummosis, a fungal or bacterial infection. These pathogens infiltrate a tree when there is a wound in the trunk which could be caused by an insect such as a peach-tree borer or even a bump from a piece of equipment.   It also appears your tree could use some judicial pruning to help it maintain a more attractive shape. The best time to do any pruning is in late winter to early spring while the tree is dormant.   If you aree concerned about the health of your cherry blossom tree, it may be helpful to consult with a local arborist to ensure that there are no underlying issues. Every tree and situation is a little different and in this case, an on-site arborist is the safest and most effective way to examine your tree and make recommendations regarding the health of the tree and any needed judicial pruning. Hiring a certified arborist will ensure that you are getting a knowledgeable and qualified tree specialist. You can find a certified arborist in your area here:  http://www.treesaregood.org/   Click on \"Find an Arborist\" at the top of the page; then click on United States from the pull-down menu. Then enter your State and City. This should bring up a list of certified arborists nearest to you. Or you may be able to locate one under \"Tree Services\" in your local Yellow Pages.\nUser: Thank you for the detailed explanation.8 On Fri, Aug 16, 2024, 1:26 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nUser: Thank you for the detailed explanation.

You are right that the heat, (stress),  is part of the problem.  I also wonder if there is too much nitrogen in your soil.  When tomato plants bloom but fail to produce fruit, the flowers die and fall off. It is usually caused by stress, which can be nutritional, environmental, or a combination of both. The most common cause is temperature, as high or low temperatures can affect pollination and watering needs.    The first fix is shade which you are doing so my thought is that the soil nitrogen levels are high.  Could this be a problem?  If you have fertilized with nitrogen on the plant or any in the area I would suggest to discontinue.  You can have your soil tested to make sure.  I am sending a publication form the University of Florida.  It is very detailed but I think it will help you.  Here is the link; https://swfrec.ifas.ufl.edu/docs/pdf/veg-hort/tomato-institute/presentations/ti2011/ozores.pdf  Please let me know if you have any other questions and please accept my apology for the delayed reply.

They look healthy but as you can see in the picture they are not more than 5- high and leaves are proportionately smaller.  I would like to try to save them. Help! \n\nThank you,\nExpert: Hi, Drew, Thanks for reaching out to UVM Extension Master Gardener Helpline. As a deciduous shrub spirea do “die back” aka loose their leaves and enter a dormant period. I’m not sure why they have not grown back to their previous height. In general, if plants are not thriving, it is because they are not getting enough of something or sometimes getting too much. This could be not getting enough sun, over watering, under watering, indirect damage/trauma to roots, lack of appropriate pruning, over mulching etc. From the picture you provided, another expert was wondering about the location too -- these spirea like rich, well-drained soils and full sun. I'm curious if they might be located in the drip zone of the house (I see brick in the background) or getting too much shade? Also, I wonder if/how they have pruned their spirea in the past. To my eyes, it looks like they are heavily mulched and I wonder if it might help to clear away/minimize the mulch that is in direct contact with the plant. Determining what may have caused the decline in the first place, may help determine how it needs to be rectified. Are there any other observations, other than the height, that could give clues as to a potential problem? It could be helpful to fill out the diagnostic worksheet and provide the history of the plants (i.e. how long have they had them, any fertilization they've used, water exposure, sun exposure, any pruning, etc.)  I’ve attached a few resources about Spirea and care. Perhaps after reviewing them, you may get a better idea of what's going on or what you’d like to try to encourage growth. https://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/spirea/ https://www.gardeningwithcharlie.com/grow-care-for-spirea/ https://ag.umass.edu/home-lawn-garden/fact-sheets/pruning-shrubs\nUser: Hi, Quinn, Thank you so much for the extensive information.

Since neem oil hasn't been effective, you might consider using a systemic insecticide that targets aphids. These are typically applied in the spring as the plant begins to leaf out, which helps control the aphid population early in the season. Be sure to follow the instructions on the insecticide label for the best results. Additionally, maintaining good plant health through proper watering and fertilization can help your crepe myrtles resist pest infestations.

Insecticidal soaps work by disrupting the cell membranes of the insects, while horticultural oils smother them. You can purchase ready-to-use products from garden centers or online. Look for brands like Safer Brand for insecticidal soap or Bonide for horticultural oil. If you prefer to mix your own, you can make a simple insecticidal soap by mixing 1 tablespoon of pure liquid soap (like Castile soap) with 1 quart of water. For horticultural oil, you can mix 1 tablespoon of neem oil with 1 quart of water and a few drops of dish soap to help it emulsify. Apply these treatments in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid leaf burn and ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of the leaves where larvae often reside. Always follow the product instructions for the best results.\"}"

We knew that it was a bit late in the season, however, we wanted to be sure the ground was somehow covered before winter.  We graded the area with machinery and then by hand.  Next, we added lime and fertilizer - the types and amounts were recommended by our local agricultural seed center.  Next, we spread seed and then straw.  Except for a small patch just east of the new building, the seed did not sprout prior to cold winter temperatures.  The area is slightly sloped and water (and probably seed, fertilizer and lime) runs off slowly and does not \"puddle\" excessively.  \nI have several questions:\n1. Our contractor used heavy machinery.  I am afraid that the soil is somewhat compacted.  Would it be a good idea to aerate this spring?  With regards to aeration, is it best to \"pull plugs\" or use \"slicer tines\" - keeping in mind that the ground is covered with slightly decomposed straw?\n2. The soil is not pure clay - but probably could use the addition of some organic matter.  Would it be good to top dress this spring?  What kind of organic matter would you suggest?  Compost - leaf or mushroom?  Suggestions for incorporating the top dress?\n3. The area is still covered (mostly) with straw.  This might present a problem if we use rakes or power equipment to prepare the area.  Suggestions?\n4. Soil testing.  I am afraid that with all of the rain we have received over the past few months, the fertilizer and lime applied in the fall has run off of the property.  How does one get a soil test kit?  Where is it sent to get analyzed?  Turn around time?  Cost?\n5. We are considering renting a Ventrac Aera-vator which has a seeder, or renting a Ventrac Aerator and then hand seeding.  Do you have experience with this equipment?  Other recommendations?\n6. Any other information you had about establishing a lawn would be helpful.  \nI have uploaded some photographs to help you understand my questions.\nThank you."

Continue using high-powered water sprays to dislodge the aphids, as this is a safe and effective method that won't harm the tree. Additionally, consider introducing beneficial insects like ladybugs or lacewings, which are natural predators of aphids. Pruning in the fall can indeed help with air circulation and may reduce aphid populations by removing some of their habitat.

I have one particularly heavily shaded area off our back deck that only gets 2-3 hours direct sun per day. So, we see it often. Would like it to hold up better year round. I plan to overseed full yard approx mid-September this year. I have a good tri-blend of TTTF recommended for this area (Calvert Co). What do you think about CRF in the shaded area? Is it more hearty, more tolerant to summer heat than typical turf-type tall fescues? If yes, any particular type/brand of CRF recommended? Thanks.\nExpert: Hi, Jordan issue with CRF in the southern parts of Maryland is disease. It tends to do better in cooler areas. You should look into hard or chewings fescue for shaded areas but it will depend on how much foot traffic those shaded spaces receive as these grasses don't tend to perform as well with heavy \"play\" as a fescue blend. These grasses still do best with about 4 hours of sun though and you will need to overseed probably yearly to keep them filled in enough. You could also look into some sedges that could spread in the area and work as a turf alternative. Mt. Cuba Center has a recent trial and study on various native sedges that were maintained as 'turf' and mowed similarly to lawn and you could entertain the idea of incorporation some of those as a ground cover, perhaps mixed with some hard or chewings fescue to get better coverage? Feel free to send us any photos, but would it be feasible to cut back on some of the lawn space with a shade garden with some paths? It could be a nice addition to look at from the deck or through house window? Could you or would you want to incorporate a destination like a seating area or bench to enjoy the shade in the hot summer months? There are many native plants that thrive in the shade and you could build an area, over time that would be lower maintenance than a lawn. Let us know if you would like additional suggestions that could help your shaded yard space function.  Emily\nUser: Thank you for the reply. Here is a pic of the shaded area from the deck, off the kitchen. The grass looks very nice in fall, winter and spring. Summer...not so much as seen here, it has turned really brown in the last 4-5 weeks. This area slopes down toward the house, so it can be wetter than normal, especially given the percentage of shade to sun. There is virtually zero foot traffic as we use the white rock borders seen at the bottom of the photo to move through this area. As to lowering the grass footprint in the area.... a good idea and I was already thinking of a circular white rock area of 10-12 feet in diameter around the gas tank...and a bench or rocking chair, maybe a small plant that likes shade. I will look into the other grass options. Within a year or so, the area above the circular rock border will be 100% liriope, Vinca or Pachysandra...with a few Nandina Firepower and Green Giants thrown in for good measure. So a nice area to look at, if the grass would cooperate  :)\nUser: And here is the Tri-Blend Fescue I will typically use in the fall, on the entire lawn, most of which gets 6-8 hours sun per day.  I buy it from a local Ag Supply store in Huntingtown.\nExpert: The seed blend for the sunny areas looks like a good blend!  For the shade it wouldn't hurt to try overseeding with a hard or chewings fescue blend from the same brand or company. The seed company shown is reputable and tends to use many of the recommended species in their seed mixes. Even though it does stay wetter, make sure to water as needed to get the seed established since the large shade trees in the wood line will most likely be sucking up much of the ground water from rain. You could reduce the lawn space in time and have less to maintain and overseed some areas as needed. Some lawn space can help define the garden areas as well so that could be an option. The sedges I mentioned from Mt. Cuba could also be an option for \"lawn\" if the shade blends don't perform well.  The least expensive option would be to use the shade fescue blend to start and take it from there.  Let us know if you have further questions.  Emily\nUser: The area in question is about 850 square feet. After some reading, I'm going to take a leap and try this tri-blend of fine fescues, see link below.  Always had used Tall in this area before.  10 pounds will allow me to seed 1/2 the bag in the early fall, and another 5 in the spring.... assuming the shelf life of seeds is long enough. One of the things said about this blend is that it works well on \"slopes\"......and this is a sloping partly shaded ground.  We shall see. Since we expect to see low morning temperatures in the mid-50s in about 3 weeks, I'll prep with a dethatcher, aerate and overseed then.   Also, I have about 1 yard of Leafgro sitting in a trailer...I assume this will be very helpful to put down before aeration.   https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MN5NO4/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A3KP4PUPMP96T0&th=1"

        "value": "User: Hi, Avery than scrap the hard egg substance that is on the trees is there any chemical spray I can use?\nThanks, Riley\nExpert: Hi, Reese now in the lifecycle of the spongy moth it is the time to scape them into soapy water. Spraying is done in the Spring and has drawbacks in addition to the timing. The insecticide Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) is effective when a caterpillar ingests the leaves on which it is sprayed. So first a tree’s leaves needs to be totally covered which is hard for a homeowner (. we don’t have the equipment). Next it kills any caterpillar which ingests it. Our native oaks support over 350 species of caterpillars besides spongy moths. Commercial pesticide applicators can treat large trees but the impact is beyond just the spongy moth. Finally, young caterpillars move in the wind (it’s called ballooning, on a strand of silk) and the adult moths fly. So spraying trees in one area does not provide total control the next year as they move. The burlap is a good option. And knowing that trees and shrubs will re-foliate. Their strength is in their trunk and roots.  If you have small or younger trees/shrubs you may want to give them a deep watering. A slow hose running 30 minutes or so works well. Or take a large 10 gallon bucket drill a few holes in the bottom, place it at the plants, fill it with water and walk away.  If we have little rain, do it again in a few weeks.  A description of the pest and suggestions for control are in this fact sheet. https://nysipm.cornell.edu/whats-bugging-you/gypsy-moths/ Burlap banding the young and/or special trees and also any nearby oaks is probably the most effective. (Young spongy moth larvae feed mostly during the day. Older larvae usually feed at night, then move down the tree to hide in bark crevices, leaf litter or other dark, protected locations during the day. The banding catches them as they move back up the tree to feed.) Trap detail is at this link https://cornell.app.box.com/s/faqiigyjtwpcngha0au6du8yd0m6emiv .\nUser: Thank you I will start scrapingWhere should I place the burlap as the moth eggs crust are several feet up the tree now Thanks, RileySent from my iPhone On Jul 27, 2023, at 2:22 PM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:﻿"

Secure the burlap with twine or string, and then fold the top half of the burlap down over the string to create a skirt. This will trap the caterpillars as they move up and down the tree. Check the burlap regularly and remove any caterpillars you find. This method is effective because it intercepts the caterpillars as they move to feed, regardless of where the egg masses are located on the tree.\"}"

For your lilac tree, since it is still quite young, it's important to encourage a strong structure. The thick center branch without buds might not necessarily be a 'sucker,' but it could be a structural branch that hasn't developed buds yet. Generally, lilacs are pruned right after they bloom to encourage more blooms the following year. Waiting three years before any pruning is not typically recommended, as regular pruning helps maintain the shape and health of the tree. \\n\\nFor your goal of having the tree grow upwards, you should focus on removing any crossing or crowded branches and thin out the lower branches to direct energy towards the upper growth. However, be cautious not to remove too much at once, as this can stress the tree. It's best to prune right after the blooms fade, which allows the tree to set buds for the next year. If the thick center branch continues to show no signs of budding in the next season, you might consider removing it then. I hope this helps, and feel free to reach out with more questions!\"}"

I also have concord grapes that are at least 100\" away & get more than I can use every fall. HELP!\nExpert: Based on the description of the issue with your grape plants, it is indeed possible that they are affected by a fungal disease called black rot (Guignardia bidwellii). Black rot is a common disease that affects various grape varieties, including green grapes, and can cause the symptoms you've described. Do you have pictures that I can evaluate? Black rot typically starts as small, dark spots on the grapes, which eventually enlarge and cause the grapes to wither and turn into \"raisins\" while still on the vine. The grapes that manage to grow to a decent size may become hard and bitter. This disease is more prevalent in warm and humid climates. To confirm whether your green grape plants are affected by black rot, it is best to closely examine the grapes for the presence of characteristic symptoms. Black rot-infected grapes will show dark, sunken spots with a distinct border. As the disease progresses, these spots may enlarge, and the grapes will eventually shrivel and become raisin-like. To manage and prevent the spread of black rot, consider implementing the following measures: Pruning: During winter pruning, remove any infected canes and grapes to reduce disease carryover.Sanitation: Remove and destroy any fallen leaves, fruit mummies, or infected grape clusters to prevent the disease from overwintering and spreading.Fungicides: Apply fungicides according to recommended schedules, especially during critical disease periods.Proper spacing and ventilation: Ensure good air circulation around the grape plants to reduce humidity and prevent the spread of the disease.Water management: Avoid overhead watering, as it can increase humidity and favor disease development. Instead, use drip irrigation or soaker hoses.  Regards, Reese Professor of Viticulture  Michigan State University\nUser: I have these pics I hope will help."

As for the virus concern, if the diagnostic lab confirms a viral infection, it's important to know that some plant viruses can spread through insects or physical contact. To prevent potential spread, maintain good sanitation practices, such as cleaning tools and avoiding contact between infected and healthy plants. Monitoring the health of your other hydrangeas and maintaining a healthy growing environment can also help mitigate risks. If you have further concerns, consulting with a local extension service or plant pathologist could provide more tailored advice.\"}"

Yesterday, it looked like I had not done it for the disease had spread upward. Obviously I am doing something wrong.  I have two rows of tomatoes about 32 in all.  Photos show the cutting of the lower infected branches.\n\nThank you, Jordan\nExpert: Hi- some of the lesions could be caused by Septoria leaf spot and the smaller dark lesions could be caused by bacterial spot disease. The latter will also produce symptoms on fruits.  Removing lower leaf branches is a good strategy for removing disease inoculum and promoting better air circulation and faster leaf drying.  Neem oil will not help much here. Fixed liquid copper is the most effective organic fungicide and Daconil and Mancozeb are the two most effective synthetic fungicides available for home gardeners. They will not cure infections but will prevent them from spreading. Jon\nUser: Would hydrogen peroxide and water be used for these lesions?    Thank you for your help – Steve"

If you'd like to do that, here are instructions for submitting a sample... https://bpp.oregonstate.edu/plant-clinic/insect-id-clinic/how-submit-insect-and-spider-materials  Yours,\nUser: I am having a courier drop off shipment today before 3pm of two containers of Live ants, one from last night with a tiny amount of water on a tissue and one from this morning with no water. All sealed in containers, then zip lock, then all inside heat-sealed plastic bag. Form was enclosed in box. There's very little alcohol on the dead ants and none on the larva -ish looking 'thing' which is labeled \"Live\". Also sending some dead in a small amount of alcohol on paper towel, and a couple other kinds of these ants' related specimens of what seem like possible fungus and larva.I meant to enclose a few notes and comments.These may have come with an estate shipment from Texas, or an ant (queen?) could have hitched a ride on transport from GulfCoast, through the southwest, through Utah and E.Oregon.I've had two spring/summer scary large allergic reactions to their many bites, when they got into my house.  My goal is to ID the ants and eventually any pathogens, whether mite or fungal, so I can learn how to treat them and prevent future illness or spread of these ants if they're not native or are somehow dangerous to others (I think my allergies make them worse for me...) I think OHSU has a lab that works on fungus research.- One specimen I found stuck to a bite, that may be a larva. Labeled with a post-it note. It had a black filament (that I keep finding in short and long lengths) attached (shows in the picture.) It fell off getting it into the container.- Other bites have mandibles and even whole ant heads that they leave embedded, very hard to see as they're so small, but bites persist with pain and itching, for me with allergies anyway. See pictures attached with commentsI sent a specimen of something else related to these ants: They leave a filament attached to their bite/sting that seems to grow into branches of filaments; maybe fungus? The specimens I sent happen to be covered in a product for itching called \"Afterbite\" that the filaments get wrapped up in over a day or so. I find filaments now on my fingers that grow at night and grow in number, branching into many. See photo attached. If you can tell if these are fungus, I may be able to eradicate them from my fingernails - they seem to want to burrow in.Thank you,Terri<personal data hidden>On Wed, Jun 28, 2023 at 10:47 AM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

When watering Bartlett pear trees, it's best to water the entire area within the drip line of the tree, not just near the trunk.

To determine this, you can place a rain gauge or a straight-sided container within the sprinkler's range and measure how long it takes to collect 2-3 inches of water. This will give you a more accurate estimate for your specific setup. \\n\\n3. The recommendation to stop watering in mid-September is to allow the tree to harden off before winter. However, if there is an extended dry spell in late fall, winter, or early spring, you may need to provide some supplemental water to prevent stress, especially if the soil is very dry. Just be cautious not to overwater, as the tree's water needs are significantly reduced during dormancy.\"}"

It's beneficial to amend the soil with compost or well-rotted manure before planting.\\n\\n3. **Spacing:** Plant the asparagus starts about 12 to 18 inches apart in rows that are 3 to 5 feet apart. This spacing allows the plants to grow without competing for nutrients and space.\\n\\n4. **Planting Near Rose Bushes:** Asparagus can be planted near rose bushes, but ensure that both plants have enough space to grow. Asparagus roots can spread, so maintain the recommended spacing to avoid competition for nutrients.\\n\\nBy following these guidelines, your asparagus should thrive alongside your rose bushes.

Unfortunately, the USDA does not provide specific guidelines for substituting sugar with honey in canning recipes, so it's best to stick to tested recipes.\\n\\nRegarding the pickled curry cauliflower recipe you mentioned, if it is not explicitly USDA-approved, I would advise against using it unless you can verify its safety through a trusted source. You might want to reach out to your local extension office for more guidance or look for similar recipes in the USDA guide that meet your dietary needs.\\n\\nIf you're interested in experimenting with honey, you might consider doing so in small batches and refrigerating them instead of canning, to ensure safety.

In the last couple of years it seems like they are taking over everything.  In my food plot, for deer, knapweed now covers about 1/3 of it and it has taken root in my hayfield.  Other invasive plants that I have come across in my food plot and in our wild flower beds are. White campion, garlic mustard, Philadelphia fleabane, common wintercress, and stinging nettle.  Any recommendations please let me know.\n\nThank you for your time.\nExpert: Your options are going to depend on your food crop plants. Grasses will have options for chemical control of these plants, broadleaf species (e.g. soybeans, clover, etc.) will not. If you could rotate to an exclusively grass planting for a year or more you could use some of the synthetic auxins (e.g. triclopyr, 2,4-D, dicamba) to get these species under control and then rotate back to a mixed planting.  In the flower beds, physical removal is always an option, though challenging for some perennials. Spot spraying with a broadspectrum product (e.g. glyphosate) or dabbing it on would also be options. Unfortunately there are no preemergence approaches if you want native plant seeds to be able to emerge. Of the species listed, spotted knapweed and garlic mustard are the ones classified as invasive by the State of Michigan. As such, there may be some programs to aid in the management of these species. You can check with your local CISMA (see below) to see if they have any programs or local advise for these species. You can also check with your local conservation district, Genesse Conservation District (https://www.geneseecd.org/).   Cooperative Invasive Species Management Areas (CISMAS).  In Michigan there are several groups working to eradicate invasive plant species. Each group covers a cluster of counties and is funded by varying sources, some volunteer efforts, and sometimes property owners themselves. Groups have varying priority species and their abilities to help vary. If they are not able to help with a particular species of interest they still may be able to point you toward local, reputable companies that can help. You can find your CISMA at this site: https://www.michigan.gov/invasives/take-action/local-resources Usually there is a coordinators email and phone number listed and sometimes there is also a web address (or you can do an internet search for the group’s name).   Please let me know if you have any questions.\nUser: Hello, Riley, Thank you for getting back to me.  It is very concerning to me the number of plants that I'm finding on our little 10 acre parcel.  The last couple of years we have been cutting vines growing up a number of the trees.  These vines were overtaking the canopies.  Some of the vines were almost 2 inches in diameter.  I have not identified these vines yet, but am going to assume they are an invasive species as well. Two more plants that I've come across are the pokeweed and the black swallow-wort.  It's unbelievable how quickly they can take over an area.  Are either of these 2 plants considered invasive by the State of Michigan? My food plot is approximately 1/4 of an acre in size and the knapweed covers about 60% of it.  Clover is what I'm trying to grow in the plot.  We then have a narrow field that is close to 2 acres in size.  We have a friend who cuts and bales it for his cattle.  The knapweed has started to take over this field now. Because of the level of knapweed in the field, the farmer will not cut and bale it.  Says the cows just spit it out when they come in contact with it.Thank you for the additional information. ScottOn Thu, Jun 1, 2023 at 4:34 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: Scott,   Pokeweed is a native species, so not invasive and if in an area that is not frequented it is providing ecosystem services.  Black swallow-wort is classified as an invasive species. Here is where you can check out the lists: https://www.michigan.gov/invasives/id-report/plants  If you can send/attach photos of the foliage on the vines you haven't identified I might be able to help with that.   I think in these fields renovation might be the only way to get the knapweed under control. Kill everything off, make sure you effectively controlled the knapweed and then replant. There may still be some that emerge from the seedbank, so you would need to be scouting and spot spraying after that as necessary. If this is a route you decide to consider you would not want to use a synthetic auxin as previously described because it will prohibit you from successfully reseeding the clover do to carryover. In this situation glyphosate would likely be the best option. You could consider doing this to half you field at a time, but you don't want to let the half not being treated go to seed or it could disperse into the half you're trying to clean up.  Is the narrow two acre field also clover?\nUser: Hi, Riley, So pokeweed is not invasive?  It spreads and can take over an area very quickly.  My wife has been working on a couple of wildflower areas, nothing big, and that pokeweed pretty much took over one of them.  They were close to 5 feet tall.As for the narrow 2 acre parcel, we've been just letting it grow and then a farmer comes in and cuts and bales it. Starting 2 years ago he would not cut 1/2 to 3/4 of an acre because there was a little too much knapweed in it and his cows would just spit it out.  The farmer said he wasn't going to be able to cut and bale it for at least a month.  With the knapweed already flowering, a neighbor brush hogged it last night.  Hopefully we got it cut before any went to seed.I have included a few pictures of some of the plants growing in the woods and open areas.  The 3 pictures that start with the label vine are of the vine that likes to grow in trees, eventually taking over the canopy.  One is of a new vine starting and the other two of much older vines.  The 2 pictures are of a vine type plant that has overtaken a small hill we use for sledding.  This can take over an area rather quickly also.  I'm not sure what this plant is called and is it invasive.  I have also attached a picture of what I believe is called Reed Grass.  I'm not sure if this is invasive and if so, how one controls it.  The last picture shows what the knapweed looked like in the 2 acre field just before cutting it.As of now, I'm hoping to hit the clover food p]lot area with glyphosate by the end of the weekend.  Targeting to have the clover area replanted by late August/early September.Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions and helping me out.ScottOn Wed, Jun 7, 2023 at 10:53 AM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

Last year two began to experience die back (withering leaves, leaves covered with a black substance, stems dying). I sprayed them with a 3-in-1 product to fight disease and insects.  This year a third Holly is experiencing the same problem, and the original two have not fully recovered.  \n\n1. Is there anything I can do to save these plants?\n2. How to I prevent the spread of these problems to the other shrubs?\nExpert: Hi, Jordan, Thank you for your question and pictures of your holly shrubs. After some research it may be that your holly has phytophthora root rot, a water mold fungi. Usually yellowing of the leaves, early leaf drop, slowed plant growth, and twig dieback are seen at early stages of the disease. Your pictures, especially the second one, appear to match this description. As the disease progresses limbs dieback to the main trunk and you may notice a black streak from the limb back towards the roots.  Some of the conditions that allow this fungi to flourish include planting in a poorly draining or wet spot, too deep planting depth, or over-mulching of the plants. This summer, with its heat, drought and now recent heavy rains, is probably further stressing your holly.  Actions you can take to prevent disease spread to the remaining shrubs include making sure they weren't planted too deeply to start. Attached is a good image of correct planting and correct mulching where the mulch is not packing up to the base of the shrub.  Treating with fungicides is successful as a preventative measure so unfortunately the two hollies that have a lot of die back are not likely to grow back. After removal, it is recommended to fumigate and aerate the soil before placing another woody shrub in its place. I have also attached links to other extension articles describing typical diseases affecting holly for your information. I'm sorry I don't have better news for you but hope this helps you save the other Hollys in your yard.

Also, applying fungicides can adversely affect the beneficial fungi your plants need to thrive. Phytophthora are oomycetes, \"fungus-like” organisms, that can already be present in the soil, or can be introduced by infected container plants, and can persist in the soil for many years. Hence, “Chemical management of these diseases usually is impractical or not economical in land-scapes.” The good news is that there are gardening methods to control the conditions that favor P. and many plants with resistance to Phytophthora! 1. Remove affected plants. 2. Replace with resistant plants. Winterberry, Yaupon, Buford & some Chinese hollies, roses, & Spicebush are some examples. For a full list, see below. 3. Avoid over fertilizing; only apply if a soil test indicates a deficiency. 4. If needed, remedy any drainage issues, such as drain-aways filled with arborist woodchips, raised beds, planting in berms, regrading, etc. 5. Enjoy your garden!

One possibility is that the tree is experiencing stress from environmental factors, such as sunscald or frost damage, which can cause bark splitting and affect leaf growth. Another possibility is a root issue, such as girdling roots or root rot, which can affect nutrient and water uptake on one side of the tree. It's also possible that there is a pest or disease affecting the tree, although the healthy appearance of the leaves makes this less likely. \\n\\nTo address this, I recommend the following steps: \\n1. Inspect the roots if possible, looking for signs of girdling or damage. \\n2. Ensure the tree is not exposed to extreme environmental conditions, such as direct afternoon sun or frost, which could be causing stress. \\n3. Consider applying a balanced fertilizer to support overall tree health. \\n4. Monitor the tree for any signs of pests or disease, and consult with a local arborist if the condition worsens. \\n\\nPruning the branches with no leaves is a good step, as it can help the tree focus its energy on healthy growth.

To treat aphids, you can start by spraying the tree with a strong jet of water to dislodge them. Additionally, you can use insecticidal soap or neem oil, which are effective and environmentally friendly options. Ensure you cover the undersides of the leaves where aphids tend to congregate.

I have to say that I can’t find any images of sawfly (larvae or other) that looks like what’s on the leaves.   The other two pictures are of a leaf I picked this morning – a more mature leaf that hasn’t really started showing yellow.  The 50x (I have a Dino-Lite) shows a lot of these things.  The 80x shows the joint of a vein (kind of hairy) with a lot of these things.  I just noticed white specks, too, that I remember covered the leaves last year, so I attached a leaf photo from then, too (River Birch Leaf 2023-05-06).   Thank you!   Shellie     From: ask=<personal data hidden> <ask=<personal data hidden>> On Behalf Of Ask ExtensionSent: Friday, July 12, 2024 8:51 AMTo: shellieluallin <<personal data hidden>>Subject: Re: River Birch leaves yellowing; have tiny brown dots on them (#0146801)"

Here are a few steps you can consider: \\n\\n1. **Spot Treatment**: If the infestation is not widespread, you might try spot-treating the affected areas with a non-selective herbicide. Be prepared to reseed these areas afterward.\\n\\n2. **Professional Lawn Care**: As you mentioned, consulting a lawn care company could be beneficial. They can provide targeted treatments and advice specific to your lawn's condition.\\n\\n3. **Preventive Measures**: To prevent further spread, maintain a healthy lawn by continuing regular watering and fertilization. A dense, healthy lawn can outcompete weeds.\\n\\n4. **Physical Removal**: For small patches, you might try physically removing the weed, ensuring you get the roots to prevent regrowth.\\n\\nIt's great that you're considering professional help, as they can offer tailored solutions and possibly identify other options for managing the weed.

First, check the appearance and smell: mature compost should be dark brown, crumbly, and have an earthy smell. If it still has a strong ammonia or sour smell, it may need more time. You can also do a bag test by sealing a small amount of compost in a plastic bag for a few days; if it still smells earthy after opening, it's likely mature. \\n\\nRegarding screening, it is not strictly necessary, but it can help create a finer product. Screening can remove larger, undecomposed materials. A 1/4-inch mesh is commonly recommended for a fine finish, but a 1/2-inch mesh can also be used if you prefer a coarser texture. This choice depends on your intended use for the compost.\"}"

To address this, you should remove and dispose of any affected leaves to prevent the spread of the fungus. Ensure your azaleas have good air circulation and avoid overhead watering to reduce moisture on the leaves. \\n\\nAs for the possible spider mites, these pests can cause damage by sucking the sap from the leaves, leading to discoloration and spots. You can check for spider mites by holding a white piece of paper under a branch and gently tapping it; if mites are present, you'll see tiny specks moving on the paper. To manage spider mites, you can spray the plants with a strong jet of water to dislodge them or use insecticidal soap or neem oil as a treatment. \\n\\nRegular monitoring and maintaining good plant health through proper watering and fertilization can help prevent these issues in the future.\"}"

I haven't spotted bugs or evidence of bugs, except the one photo that seems to show some chewed-on leaves.  Photos attached. Thank you.\nExpert: Hi, thanks for the question. There can be different reasons for curled, puckered, and distorted leaves.  Probably the most common is aphids.  Check the back of the leaves, not just the curled leaves.  If you see ants climbing on the viburnums it can also indicate the presence of aphids.  Thrips can cause similar damage as can downy mildew.  The aphids can be sprayed off with a hard spray of water.  Insecticidal soap is a good follow-up.

The intervention I’m seeing involves monthly supplementation of EDDHA Iron (more specifically a product called Sprint 138). Wanted to reach out to see if this seems feasible for an action plan and diagnosis. \n\nThanks for the help! (Pictures attached)\nExpert: Hi, Morgan,  just a few questions before I develop a more detailed answer for you.  Iron deficiency can produce the situation you are seeing in the maple leaves so no argument there.  But this condition can also be produced by a lack of manganese and/or magnesium in the plant.  Have you checked these possibilities out? Also to provide you with my best answer, I would like to know the pH of the soil surrounding your maple.  If the pH is too high (greater than 7.3), the maple won't be able to take up iron/magnesium, manganese.  If this is true for the soil around your maple, administering EDHHA iron will not accomplish anything and will be a waste of your money. Have you recently had an analysis done of the soil around your maple? I am looking forward to your response so that we can quickly get to some resolution. Thanks for using our forum.\nUser: Hello, Casey for the quick reply. I have not done research into manganese/magnesium deficiency, but will do some now.   I actually have a soil analysis kit being delivered this afternoon.

Using EDDHA Iron, such as Sprint 138, is a feasible intervention. This chelated form of iron is effective in a wide range of soil pH levels, which is beneficial if your soil pH is on the higher side. However, continue to monitor the tree for any changes and consider a comprehensive approach that includes checking for other potential deficiencies like manganese and magnesium, as these can also contribute to similar symptoms.

I’ve never sprayed any chemicals. \nThe viburnum pulled right out of the ground, a stem  at a time.\nExpert: Hi, Alex - I see this shrub is along a road.  Is it possible that there is salt put on this road in winter?   Is the snow plowed to this side of the road?  It's possible that snow could build up (especially in Kent county) and when it melts, it could overwhelm the soil and rot the roots.  Is it possible that Kent County might be spraying the roadside with a chemical of some sort?  I have a lot of questions about this site.   Even though this link is from Georgia, I think there is some very valuable information here about preparing the site for your shrub:  https://extension.uga.edu/publications/detail.html?number=B932 If you would like to get your soil tested, here is a link for that from the MSU Extension:  https://homesoiltest.msu.edu/get-started/ Most shrubs need good drainage, if your soil is compacted clay, that might have an influence on whether your shrub lives or dies.  I really hope this helps you.\nUser: I live on a private road in the country. Only a dozen houses so not a lot of traffic. Our neighbors take turns plowing the snow and do nothing else to it. So no salt or chemicals. No clay here, quite sandy with compost added some.  The drainage is very good. This lilac sits up on a hill going up into our yard.  So it’s not waterlogged. The same thing happened to my 10 year old viburnum by the foundation of our house.  Just suddenly started turning brown and quickly died. I’m wondering about a virus, a rodent but I’ve no idea! So strange.  Wondered if it’s the warmer climate here now. Not likely. I have a Miss Kim lilac just starting to do the same. I will check the link you sent. I’m very baffled. Thank you!! Linda K.On Wed, Aug 21, 2024 at 5:39 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

There exist in numerous locations around the property, both in sunny and shaded conditions and under a diversity of tree types from Maples to White Pine, Hawthorn ect. They all receive natural rain and have required very little attention after their first year of being established. Our only problem is that each year we experience random die of of individual branches and sometimes whole plants.  The leaves don't show any signs of stress but a branch will quickly (1-2weeks) go from bright and viberant to being completely browned and dried.  I've been trying to figure out the cause of this died off and it doesn't seem to be related to water or light because it randomly occurs across the property.  Yesterday I finally notice one common denominator and have attached a picture for reference.  At the base of each dying branch or plant I've noticed an active \"bleeding\" wound.  I'm assuming this is sap but I haven't discovered any insects.  As I looked around I found this bleeding area on every dead or dying branch but didn't see it on adjacent health plants.  \nCan someone help identify what may be causing this and a possible treatment?  It seems to specifically be related to our low Grow sumac and one fragrant sumac bush but not on any other plants in our landscape."

Submitting a sample to a plant pathology lab is a good step to confirm the diagnosis. In the meantime, ensure good sanitation by removing and destroying affected branches to prevent the spread of the disease. Avoid overhead watering to reduce moisture on the foliage, and consider applying a fungicide if a fungal infection is confirmed. Regular monitoring and maintaining plant health through proper fertilization and care can also help mitigate the issue.\"}"

        "value": "User: Near MSU at Gull Lake I have 3/4 acre of both eastern star moles due to huge piles of dirt above ground in wet areas with a high water table(50 + piles)  and far too many tunnels every where else. I have killed (with a shovel) a grey mole w/o the starred nose. At 70 years of age, I can only bait with poisonous worms by TomCat (Scotts) which are less expensive than the Talpirid fake worms. Will the Tomcat worms be effective with the star nosed mole as well as the other varieties that my lawn has? Getting rid of moles is very, very expensive and very tie consuming. Both varieties contain the same poison. Tomcat seems to high a higher level. HELP!\nUser: In addition with some of the above wet dirt on top of the grass, some are 6-9 inches tall.  How do you bait these huge mounds of dirt? Are there dens below with female moles ready to deliver 3-6 babies or is it merely dirt from tunnels that are very deep into the ground?\nExpert: There are two types of moles active in Michigan: eastern moles and star-nosed moles. The eastern mole is the mole that creates surface tunnels all over the place. The star-nosed mole is the mole that forms the big piles or volcanoes of soil on the surface from deeper tunnels. Moles do not hibernate; they just use deeper tunnels during the winter. This time of year, as the soil warms up they are mating, giving birth and seeking food for their young. They eat mostly earthworms and some grubs, rarely plant roots or bulbs (mice & squirrels).  More info in the attached links: Moles in the Lawn-MSU Moles In Lawn-Purdue Who's Digging in my Yard-MSU Diagnosing wildlife holes in yard-Iowa  I've Got Moles (video) MSU https://woodlandstewards.osu.edu/sites/woodlands/files/imce/0011.pdf https://naturalresources.extension.iastate.edu/encyclopedia/moles-damage-management https://extension.umn.edu/planting-and-growing-guides/how-trap-moles https://extension.entm.purdue.edu/publications/ADM-10.pdf https://naturalresources.extension.iastate.edu/wildlife/diagnosing-holes-yard 1) Identify an active tunnel 2) Open up tunnel 3) Prime the tines 4) Build soil obstacle 5) Backfill area above tunnel I've had success with the harpoon trap, on eastern moles, especially following steps 1 and 3 from the video above. You will need to be both persistent and patient to win this battle. Setting more than one trap at a time will help reduce the unwanted population quicker.  The star-nosed mole is a tougher challenge because it's tunnels are deeper, making use of traps less effective.  You are using an effective poison in the TomCat product.  Wear latex gloves when setting the trap or placing the bait to keep human scent off the bait.  Follow the instructions on the package.  To win this battle you must be patient and persistent.  Start now!  MSU Extension does not endorse any retailers or brands.\nUser: I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND STILL......The volcanic-like dirt mound is merely an indicator that the star-nosed mole came up for air as he was digging, correct? The mole also was removing the dirt out of his tunnel that he was digging, correct? Do we now start \"here\" with opening up a hole to let light in under this \"removed\" mound of dirt? There is no visible tunnel activity from this mole species above ground. Once we determine if there remains activity at this juncture point, because the mole will close the hole up, we begin the baiting or trapping here, correct? It seems as if most of all published literature on moles deals with the eastern mole species and little or nothing on the star-nosed mole. How do you bait or trap in an invisible tunnel \"to the eye\" that is \"feet\" below the surface of the ground? Or........again.......is \"under each mound\" of soil your only point of contact in an attempt to locate any activity? The mounds are 1-2+ months old now. I have 50+ mounds of dirt now and have been hesitant to get started based on wasting huge money in my purchased \"tomcat\" poison worms and very valuable time spent and not finding the right information on addressing this very different mole.  I am a disabled old man who can hardly stand. BUT NOW, the mole eradication season is upon me! What to do with this mole species? I understand the eastern  mole. I have 3/4 acre of visible above ground tunnels.. Please help again with how you address this unusual mole. Thanks. Steve"

The volcanic-like mounds are created as they push soil to the surface while digging deeper tunnels. Since these mounds are your only visible indicators of their presence, they are your best starting point for intervention. Here are some steps you can take:\\n\\n1. **Identify Active Mounds**: Since the mounds are 1-2 months old, it's important to determine if they are still active. You can do this by flattening a few mounds and checking after a day or two to see if they are rebuilt, indicating active tunnels.\\n\\n2. **Baiting**: Once you identify active mounds, you can place the TomCat poisonous worms near these areas. Follow the instructions carefully, and wear gloves to avoid leaving human scent on the bait.\\n\\n3. **Trapping**: While trapping star-nosed moles is more difficult due to their deep tunnels, you can try setting traps near the active mounds. Harpoon traps may not be as effective for star-nosed moles, but they can still be worth a try if placed correctly.\\n\\n4. **Professional Help**: Given your physical limitations, it might be beneficial to hire a professional pest control service that specializes in wildlife management. They can provide more targeted and effective solutions.\\n\\nRemember, persistence and patience are key. It may take some time to see results, but starting with these steps should help you manage the mole population more effectively.\"}"

What are they and how do I get rid of them?\nExpert: The insects you have are beetles, it is hard to say if you have carpet beetles, storage pest beetles or wood boring beetles. It would be helpful if you could examine your food storage area such as a pantry for any signs of an infestation in the food packages. The other type of beetle carpet beetles can damage items such a any products that have dried organic parts such as wool clothing, furs, dried flower arrangements, feathers as examples. The last kind are wood boring beetles, The damage they cause are to wooden furniture where they leave fine power where they bored into wooden furniture. I have attached a publication on these three types of beetles. If you can, read them and let me know if one matches the problem you have with these beetles. That you are finding them all year around means you need to try managing this pest ASAP. Let me know if you have any additional questions. Rich\nUser: Hi, Quinn, Thank you so much for sending this information—it is extremely helpful. Except that I don’t think any of these are the beetles I have. I’ve definitely ruled out the carpet beetles--my beetles don’t look anything like any of the three that are shown in Pub 7436. For one thing, my beetles do not have short antennae, their antennae are long. I’ve also ruled out the various kinds of pantry beetles. For one thing, my beetles are tiny compared to those shown as \"actual size.” For another, I have zero evidence of infestation in any of my food storage areas, and believe me, I checked very carefully! So that leaves the powderpost beetles. At first I thought they might be a possible candidate, especially because the upstairs room where my beetles are most pronounced, and in which they appeared first, is completely paneled in wood! However, close reading of PNW 326 leads me to the conclusion that they are not my beetle. My beetle is medium brown with an almost greenish tint; its body is definitely not \"dark brown to nearly black\" (lyctidae), or \"reddish-brown to nearly black” (anobiids and bostrichids). My beetle has antenna that are very skinny and very long, almost a third as long as its head/body; its antenna do not look like any of the pictured antenna. My beetle has gold-colored legs. I do not see any exit (emergence) holes in the wood, nor any powdery frass.I am wondering what to do next. I wouldn’t be concerned because I’ve always just vacuumed them up when they showed up every spring (this has been going on pretty much ever since I moved in 40 years ago). But now, I’m seeing them all year round (though not in the great numbers I see every spring). And, as I mentioned, they are now for the first time showing up in other parts of the house, including a few downstairs! Would it be possible to gather some and bring them down to show you? I really don’t want to “employ a professional…insecticide or fumigant” unless I have to. If that’s what you think I should do, do you have any suggestions for what kind I should buy? Many thanks for your help!Cathleen SmithOn Mar 24, 2023, at 4:23 PM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: Your note does not surprise me.

When replacing the bush, consider choosing a different type of plant that is not susceptible to viburnum beetles.

It may be lack of water since we are now in a dry spell. Young trees need about 5 gallons of water per week for the first 2-3 years.  Have you fertilized around it?

Herbicide damage can cause leaf distortion, discoloration, and in severe cases, plant death. Whether the tree will recover depends on the extent of the damage. If the tree is otherwise healthy and the damage is not too severe, it may recover and produce new growth next year. However, if the herbicide caused significant damage to the tree's vascular system, it might struggle to recover. To help the tree recover, ensure it is well-watered, especially during dry spells, and avoid any additional stressors like fertilization or pruning until it shows signs of recovery. Monitoring the tree next spring will be crucial to assess its recovery.

Thanks\nExpert: Lots of questions...When did it start?  Were all areas shown affected at once or did it start small and grow to what is shown?  Do you irrigate, if yes what time of day and how much?  Do you fertilize your lawn, how much & when?  Do you apply weed killer, what and when?  Do you have a thatch buildup, if yes how thick?  Do the affected areas follow the tracks of your mower when you mow?  Please email me back answers to each of these questions to provide more information so I can attempt to provide an answer.  The photos do not provide enough info to give an answer. I recommend doing a soil test on your lawn to learn more about your soil including soil type, pH, nutrient levels and more. Knowing the type and fertility of your soil is the starting point to establishing & maintaining a strong turf that can resist diseases, moss and insects/grubs and look great. More info here: Don't Guess-Soil Test-MSU and MSU Home Soil Test-self mailer\nUser: I will attempt to answer your questions to the best of my ability. In early spring my grass looked lush and green, I fertilized withnScotts pre-emergent in April.I planned to apply fertilizer in early June but due to the hot dry wheather I did not. I began to notice brown areas in June and yes, now that you ask they did seem to follow the lawn mower tracks. The areas have grown as time went on. I watered once but usually do not due to expensive water bill. I had one very weedy part in my lawn so I put weed killer on that section but not the whole lawn as the rest was pretty weed free.This may or may not be related but on one side of my driveway,each year the grass resembles the pictures I enclosed. It has been a battle for many years and we have reseeded a couple of times and even sodded once, each time the new grass looks great for about two years and then starts dying in areas again.I had a soil test done on that area and they just recommended the usual fertilizer program. In addition my soil is a  lot of clay and I have it areated sprint and fall. I hope this helps you in diagnosing my problem and I really appreciate your help. Thanks again.  Pat\nExpert: Another question:  Did you do a MSU soil test?  If yes, send me the 6 digit access code so I can review it.  If no, can you send me a scan of the results?  If your soil test was not done within the past 2 years you should do another one on the problem side of the drive per the link in my first reply.  You state that one side of the drive has the problem (which shows up 2 yr after reseeding) and not the other so we need to concentrate on that side.  Does water drain off the drive toward the problem side?  I'm not sure you have a disease problem.  It might be soil fertility, compaction and/or grubs.   Aeration of clay soil is needed at times.  I hope it is CORE aeration.  A week before core aeration you should fertilize with 0.5# of nitrogen per 1000SF.  After core aeration you should rake in 1/4\" to 1/2\" of compost over the lawn problem area to help break up the clay and add organic material.  Read the attached articles on core aeration: Core Aeration of Lawns-MSU Core Aeration of Lawns-Iowa St Lawn aeration-UMd\nUser: Lawn problemSent from my iPad On Jul 25, 2023, at 11:48 PM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:﻿"

Since you have clay soil, core aeration is beneficial, and it's good that you are already doing this. To improve the soil structure, consider applying a thin layer of compost after aeration to add organic matter. This can help break up the clay and improve drainage. Since the problem follows the mower tracks, it might also be related to soil compaction from mowing. Ensure that your mower blades are sharp to avoid tearing the grass, which can make it more susceptible to stress. Once you receive the soil test results, we can further refine the fertilization strategy. In the meantime, avoid over-fertilizing, especially during dry spells, as this can stress the grass further. If water drainage from the driveway is an issue, consider creating a barrier or improving drainage to prevent water from pooling in the problem area. If grubs are suspected, you might want to check for their presence and consider treatment if necessary.\"}"

Since she has dogs (in a fenced area), she want's to do this without using pesticides or creating a stir.  Any ideas?\nExpert: Hi, Harper,   It would be good to know which wasps you are dealing with. There is a good chance that if the nest isn't in a hole in the ground it is a paper wasp (Polistes dominula) rather than a yellowjacket (in the genera Vespula and Dolichovespula). Paper wasps are similar in color to yellowjackets but they are slimmer. Also, their legs hang down characteristically when they fly. Their nests also are open and not closed in by a paper wall. These nests typically collapse naturally at the end of August.  Paper wasp: https://cals.cornell.edu/new-york-state-integrated-pest-management/outreach-education/whats-bugging-you/bees-and-wasps/identifying-bees-and-wasps/paper-wasps vs Yellowjacket: https://cals.cornell.edu/new-york-state-integrated-pest-management/outreach-education/whats-bugging-you/bees-and-wasps/identifying-bees-and-wasps/yellowjackets  If they are paper wasps, they are very passive and pose very little stinging risk unless the nest is directly disturbed. The risk is that the nests are often small and are readily encountered accidentally. But since you know where this nest is (and assuming I am correct that you have paper wasps) just let everyone know where it is and to leave it be.  It can be cleaned out in the fall, when all the wasps are dead.   Best, Andony\nUser: Andony,\nThank you for your response.

It is located in Kingsdale MN about 40 min south of Duluth. Quick description of the property is that the soil is generally very wet. Our well is only dug to 15 feet deep so the ground in the spring is very wet with just hand dug holes filling it with water some years. Las year during the drought though it did dry out like everything else so we did have to do some hand watering when we could with rain water we collected. I do have a old dog cage that was left when we bought it that we have planted in before that is about 8 feet long 4 feet wide and 7 feet tall. Outside of that I don't have any other barriers to plants things in to protect them from the deer. The deer do seem to stay away from the peppers but will nibble on the tomaters.\n\n During the non winter months one of us on average will be able to get up there once every other week. We have done different things up there before with Tomatoes, spicy peppers, and cucumbers seeming to do the best with the minimal attention but we end up missing some harvest windows with the cucumbers and they water log badly. The other thing we have miss judged is the planting window. That last freeze always seems to get us even into May and we end up having to replant.\n\nSo in your opinion what kind of plants would you do in the cage and outside the cage and when should we plant them. Let me know if I could get you any other info that might help as well. Thanks!!"

After applying the herbicide, it's generally recommended to keep horses off the treated pasture for at least 7 to 14 days, but this can vary based on the specific product used, so always check the label for guidance. As for planting a grass or crop to suppress these weeds, consider overseeding with a competitive grass species like tall fescue or orchardgrass, which can help outcompete the weeds by providing dense ground cover.

To identify its presence before your carrots mature, you can look for signs such as small, rust-colored flies around your carrot plants, especially in the early morning or late afternoon when they are most active.

Using yellow sticky traps can help monitor adult fly activity, and applying row covers can prevent the flies from laying eggs on your plants. Regularly inspecting your plants and soil for signs of larvae can also help in early detection.\"}"

I cut these bushes back last August/2022 due to the info I could gather online.  I treated them & the soil w/Daconil spray as pictured.  I read how it is VERY hard to eradicate this problem.  So lucky me…..it’s all back this year.  I just got done cutting as much of the branches off so as not to have more spread before I can get some professional advice.  Also,  bagging these trimmings & being careful not to spread the spores.  Do you have any solutions to this problem?  I would certainly appreciate it.  Thanks!\nJan\nExpert: Actually, you have scale, not black spotted fungus.  Which is why the Daconil is not helping.  Scale is an insect that has a hard shell to protect them while they feed on the plant.  Most likely, the crawling stage of the scale, which is much smaller, fed on the leaves in early spring.  Now you are seeing the adults on the stems.  If you saw black sooty mold on your leaves (which would reasonably lead you to believe the plant has a fungus) that is honeydew.  When the crawler stage feeds, they release a sticky substance called honeydew that collects dirt and debris from the air and makes the leaves look like they have a fungus.   I don't know which scale you have, there are many kinds, but usually you would treat your shrubs in the early spring just as the are budding out with a dormant oil.  If you decide to treat your shrubs, be sure it is labeled for use on scale and follow the directions for time of use.  If these are fruiting cherry bushes, be sure the product label states it can be used on fruit trees.   Pruning the bushes for more air circulation will also help.   Here is an article on scale for more information: https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/controlling_scale_insects_in_fruits\nUser: Hi, Charlie, Thanks so much for your quick  response.  I really appreciate all of your detailed answers.  I’m disappointed that I cut all of my bushes back.  These cherry flowering bushes definitely have scale and honey dew.  I will treat them as the products suggest & hope for the best.  Hopefully I can eliminate this problem from my plants once & for all.Thanks again,JanSent from my iPhoneOn Jun 20, 2023, at 12:40 PM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:﻿"

I planted it last spring and noticed that it developed spots on the leaves and they weren't as deep green as my neighbor's tree, (same kind, planted at the same time). I thought it was from all the hail we had but the same problem is occurring this year and there was no hail. Can you help me figure out what is going on  and what I should do about it? I really don't want to lose this little tree.\nGratefully,\nSeatoo Rounds\nExpert: Hi, Morgan,  I think what's happening is that the iron chlorosis (the yellowing leaves) in the tree are starting to sunburn from the lack of chlorophyll. We sometimes see this happen with maples and other trees that are susceptible to iron chlorosis. Essentially the leaves are scorched.  Iron chlorosis can be caused by a number of things: compacted soils, wet soils, soils high in pH (where iron cannot be taken up by the tree), and salty soils. While Amur Maackia is a great smaller ornamental tree, it is susceptible to chlorosis.  What you can try to do is modify the cultural conditions around the tree - depending on where the tree is planted, consider drying out the soil a little. You can also do iron treatments, such as foliar sprays or soil drenches using supplemental iron.  If doing drenches, use an iron chelate that is either EDDHA or EDMA. Mix it in a bucket according to the instructions and then pour it at the base of the tree (all grass and mulch must be removed so you're applying it to just soil). Utah State has some more details and information that you can consider: https://extension.usu.edu/forestry/trees-cities-towns/tree-care/preventing-iron-chlorosis\nUser: Oh, and PS, where can I purchase it?  :-D  On Tuesday, June 25, 2024, 06:01:01 PM MDT, seatoo rounds <<personal data hidden>> wrote:     Hi, Morgan,   Thank you so much for responding!

They look like fully-hydrated water-retaining polymer granules, such as those included in some potting mixes (\"moisture control\" types), diapers (if a wild animal was rummaging through garbage somewhere nearby), and other products. They look like dry pellets or crystals when dehydrated and swell to many times their size when wet, having a gel-like consistency. When used in potting mix, the intent is for them to store water for plant roots as the soil dries out, but this has not been scientifically proven to be effective; still, their inclusion in soil blends is relatively common. In either case, you can just collect them and dispose of them so they don't pollute stormwater runoff (well...when it finally rains again) or irrigation water runoff.  Miri\nUser: Great response!

I will use a flashlight to check for slugs as these plants are not under mulch and are not in a damp environment.\nExpert: Greetings, Kathryn, and thank you for your question about holes in your Indian Summer Rudbeckia plant. I think you are on the right track in suspecting the damage is caused by slugs. The pattern in your photos is consistent with slug damage. They can travel a distance in search of food sources, and are not limited to damp environments, especially at night. They will feed on young Indian Summer Rudbeckia. The Missouri Botanical Garden fact sheet says: “Watch for slugs and snails on young plants.” You suggested using a flashlight to check for slugs, which is an excellent idea. It will help you confirm that slugs are your culprit. Another option for “catching them in the act” is to place a dish of beer, yeast-sugar water, or other fermented liquid near the plants in question. The slugs are attracted to the beer/yeast/fermented liquid, fall in and drown. You might not destroy enough of them to control the issue, but it is an easy diagnostic tool. I’ve used it several times and it has worked every time. This article from the University of Minnesota Extension has more specific directions. To find them, you will need to expand the section called “Handpick or Trap Slugs”.  If you do find slugs, the same article has information on how to protect your garden, as does this article from The Ohio State University Extension’s Ohioline. As you can see, there are a variety of control methods including mechanical, cultural and chemical control. The choice is yours. If you choose chemical controls be sure to follow all package directions and use personal protective equipment when recommended.  I hope this information will help you stop the damage being done to your Rudbeckia. In preparing a response to your question I consulted research-based sites to verify that my response was accurate and current. Links to the best of those sites are embedded in the above response and/or listed in the resources below. If you need any clarification or further information, simply reply to this email and it will come directly to me. I would love to hear from you to find out if we have helped you to resolve your issue. And, if you have time, completing the survey at the end of this response will be very helpful to us.

I checked the plants last night and found no slugs. What puzzled me was there were no slime trails? I then considered a worm as they eat holes in leaves and also chew the edges of leaves, but I inspected the upper and lower leaves and there were no visible worms. I have always enjoyed Rudbeckias and especially the Indian Summer as well as other varieties, and will hope to be able to include them in my garden!

I planted it last spring and noticed that it developed spots on the leaves and they weren't as deep green as my neighbor's tree, (same kind, planted at the same time). I thought it was from all the hail we had but the same problem is occurring this year and there was no hail. Can you help me figure out what is going on  and what I should do about it? I really don't want to lose this little tree.\nGratefully,\nSeatoo Rounds\nExpert: Hi, Morgan,  I think what's happening is that the iron chlorosis (the yellowing leaves) in the tree are starting to sunburn from the lack of chlorophyll. We sometimes see this happen with maples and other trees that are susceptible to iron chlorosis. Essentially the leaves are scorched.  Iron chlorosis can be caused by a number of things: compacted soils, wet soils, soils high in pH (where iron cannot be taken up by the tree), and salty soils. While Amur Maackia is a great smaller ornamental tree, it is susceptible to chlorosis.  What you can try to do is modify the cultural conditions around the tree - depending on where the tree is planted, consider drying out the soil a little. You can also do iron treatments, such as foliar sprays or soil drenches using supplemental iron.  If doing drenches, use an iron chelate that is either EDDHA or EDMA. Mix it in a bucket according to the instructions and then pour it at the base of the tree (all grass and mulch must be removed so you're applying it to just soil). Utah State has some more details and information that you can consider: https://extension.usu.edu/forestry/trees-cities-towns/tree-care/preventing-iron-chlorosis\nUser: Oh, and PS, where can I purchase it?  :-D  On Tuesday, June 25, 2024, 06:01:01 PM MDT, seatoo rounds <<personal data hidden>> wrote:     Hi, Morgan,   Thank you so much for responding!

But you can contact your local Extension Office in Arapahoe or Douglas County and ask where to purchase the product(s).  You can either mix the formulation in a bucket and apply it at the base of the tree....or sprinkle the powder at the base of the tree and then water it in. Because it's iron, it's a very dark red color.  Foliar spraying can be inconsistent and cause phytotoxicity to leaves if done when it's too hot. Mixing and pouring is far easier. Just follow the instructions on the label of the product.  Be sure to water the tree prior to application and following application to make sure it has enough water to pull the iron into its system.

When you repot, gently break up any compacted root ball to encourage better root growth and water absorption. As for watering, check the top inch of soil; if it's dry, it's time to water. Given the lack of sunlight, try to place your tree in the brightest spot available, or consider using a grow light to supplement the light it receives.

Make sure you are using a balanced fertilizer or one with lower nitrogen content. Additionally, check your watering practices; radishes need consistent moisture but should not be waterlogged.

It was staked tightly to a rigid pole and the bark was rubbed off. When the bark is removed it exposes the layer under the bark that provides the water and nutrients from the roots to the tree.  When that is exposed the tree dies.  I could go into apple tree selection planting and pruning but it is more helpful to refer you to https://ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/hyg-1401 which lays out the process.You can get further assistance at your OSU Extension Office.

Is there anything I can do to improve it and plant my shrub there?\nExpert: Yes, this has been the common experience around the region, as the rainy week-plus we had didn't deposit all that much water. The drought from earlier in summer that affected much of the state is ongoing in many areas (see linked map, which is updated weekly).  Adding organic matter like compost is a good way to improve the moisture-holding capacity of the soil. A shovel-full, more or less, will probably suffice for the average shrub in terms of root ball size. Avoid over-amending as this can set the plant up for stress later as the roots expand out from the original planting hole, though you could still top-dress the soil surrounding the plant with about an inch of compost, plus a couple inches of an organic mulch (bark, wood chips, etc., that biodegrades) that will itself compost into more organic matter over time. This will keep the soil well-amended over the long term, as soil life works that layer into the root zone naturally.  After planting (even if there was no drought), monitor the plant for watering needs so it establishes well and maintains a vigorous root system. The linked page provides guidance for how to water and how to determine when watering is needed.  Miri\nUser: Thank you very much.

Planting them in the ground now should be safe, even with nighttime temperatures dropping to the 50s and upper 40s. However, ensure that they are well-watered and consider adding a layer of mulch to help insulate the roots and retain soil moisture. If a frost is expected, you might want to cover them temporarily with a frost cloth or similar material to protect them. Keeping them in pots indoors until spring is an option, but planting them now will allow them to establish their root systems before the winter, which can be beneficial for their growth in the spring.\"}"

I had 2 carrot containers a swiss chard container & one big container with 4 different lettuce varieties. In the beginning everything first began to have purpling and then everything went necrotic and died. I cleaned the area with bleach, I'm using all new containers, and I just had a basil plant and 2 pepper plants begin to have these initial signs so frustrating. Different soil, mostly all different seed. And this is a portion of my crops I intend to put out for spring. So I was pretty bummed as u might figure. I culled everything I saw it on immediately. Last year I asked you guys, various seed companies and no one had what even seemed like a feasible or good suggestion. I got things like lack of phosphorus, but I wasn't lacking phosphorus plus they were still just seedlings. The the extension here blamed the fox farm ocean forest soil I was using(just like 40% the other 60% was inert coco), however I gave 2 plants to my sister before this outbreak or what have you happened, and hers were fine. Also I have used the soil before with good results as a partial component to my indoor growing mixes. I have everything in 7 inch greenhouse lids on 10x20 trays at this point, in part because I just didn't trust the environment after that loss. Then sure nuff 3 plants popped up with it. I included the 1 photo I thought to take. Really frustrated, so far it's just those 3 which promptly went in the garbage. It was wild all four separate containers and a separate pot too infected and destroyed. I neemed some of the things that were near it but not showing signs this time. Wish I had tried Neem before. But just curious if you have any thoughts on this.\n\nAlso what is a good high yielding purple asparagus strain for northern MN that I could search for 2 year crowns of, or if you know of a reasonable and reliable source to purchase such crowns that would be lovely too. \n\nThank you"

        "value": "User: Is there a type of shrub I can plant near my home which repels pests like bugs, mice, moles and snakes?\nExpert: No, there is no plant capable of repelling all of those organisms. Instead, managing habitat to discourage rodents from visiting (by keeping firewood away from the house, for example, or not having bark mulch or leaf mulched piled against the foundation) will be of more use, and sealing any gaps/cracks in exterior walls can also go along way towards keeping them out of a home. Snakes go where their prey is (and very much try to avoid conflicts with people), so by keeping mice or rats at bay, you're less likely to have snakes. (Though snakes are varied and several small species eat other things, like slugs/snails, worms, and insects, and are incapable of harming people.) Snakes are great pest control in home landscapes and it would be best to let them roam outside so they can consume pests before their populations become large. This includes rodents that can carry ticks that pick up Lyme Disease and other pathogens.  Most insects are not pests (for people or plants), and many actually are beneficial, helping to eat the insects that are pests. Insects that are pests take specific approaches to control, so they would need to be identified first. For example, mosquito control efforts would not be the same as for carpenter bees, so there is no single way to repel all of them. Broad-spectrum pesticides that kill a variety of insects also kill the beneficial ones, including pollinators (bees, butterflies), fireflies, and those that prey on pests.  Moles and voles are often confused for each other, as both make small holes in the soil and can create tunnels throughout parts of the yard. Moles eat worms, insects, and similar organisms; voles eat plant matter (roots, sometimes whole plants for perennials and annuals). Both tend to go away on their own in just a season or two because they are short-lived and prey for a variety of animals, including foxes, snakes, owls, and hawks. Do not use any poison baits to control them (because this can injure or kill those other animals), but if needed, lethal traps can capture moles and voles to reduce the population faster.

There is nothing on that level for them to eat. I was trying to get specifics on how to keep them away from the foundation of the house where they likely get in my home. Perhaps I should consult a contractor as the exterminators I hired months ago are unsuccessful in keeping the critters out of my home.  Just thought you should know the entire picture.   Sincerely, Avery"

Here are some steps you can take:\\n\\n1. **Seal Entry Points**: Inspect the exterior of your home, especially around the foundation, for any cracks or gaps. Pay special attention to areas where utilities enter the house. Use caulk or steel wool to seal small gaps, and consider using hardware cloth or other barriers for larger openings.\\n\\n2. **Habitat Modification**: Keep the area around your foundation clear of debris, woodpiles, and dense vegetation that can provide cover for these animals. Trim back any overhanging branches and keep grass short.\\n\\n3. **Professional Assessment**: Since exterminators have not been successful, consulting a contractor or a pest control specialist who focuses on exclusion methods might be beneficial. They can provide a thorough inspection and suggest structural changes to prevent entry.\\n\\n4. **Natural Deterrents**: Consider using natural deterrents like peppermint oil-soaked cotton balls for mice, though these are often more effective as a supplementary measure rather than a primary solution.\\n\\n5. **Regular Monitoring**: Regularly check the basement and surrounding areas for signs of entry or activity, and address any new issues promptly.\\n\\nThese steps, combined with professional advice, should help reduce the likelihood of these animals entering your home. If you have any further questions or need more specific advice, feel free to ask.\"}"

I don’t want to wipe them out but I don’t want to lose my last two plants either. What do you suggest?\nExpert: Hi, Dakota are great! The plants are doing their job by feeding native insects, but yes unfortunately hungry caterpillars can ravish plants.  They most likely won't kill the plants, just defoliate them, and the roots should hold reserves to grow next season or possibly send up more growth this season. Besides picking some off, although that kind of defeats the purpose, maybe you could offer an additional food source? Could you add some additional milkweed for them even if you don't plan on adding it to that garden space long term, you could keep it potted (and watered) to give them more to munch on, or move them to the potted plant and move the plant away from the devoured in ground plants.  Maybe you could relocate a few caterpillars to some roadside milkweed in a safe location or hop on a social media gardening group and see if anyone nearby would like to share in the native plant gardening journey! Let us know if you have further questions. Emily\nUser: Thank you. I ended up relocating them to a Hemp dogbane plant nearby that they seem to be enjoying.   Sure hope my milkweed come back next year."

Since you've already identified the presence of voles and have tried trapping, you might want to continue using traps but increase their number and placement to cover more of the tunnel network. Ensure that traps are placed perpendicular to the tunnels for better effectiveness. Additionally, using a non-toxic bait like VoleX can be a good strategy, as it specifically targets voles without harming predators. You can also consider habitat modification by removing dense vegetation and debris where voles might hide. Regularly monitoring the garden for new tunnels and signs of activity will help you stay ahead of the problem.

Any advice or recommendations would be appreciated.\nExpert: Hi, Dakota, It is hard to say from the photos, so I have some questions. It can be risky to plant broadleaf evergreens such as cherry laurel in the fall. That does not give them much time to develop a substantial root system to support themselves. Broadleaf evergreens continue to lose moisture through the stomata (pores) in their leaves, especially on very sunny or windy days, but cannot take up additional moisture from frozen soil. I suspect the frigid weather most of PA experienced right before Christmas is partly to blame. My question is mostly about the soil where they are planted - does it drain well, or is it heavy clay that holds a lot of water? Cherry laurels require good drainage. Also, I can't tell from the images if they may have been planted a little too deeply - they should have been planted at the same depth as they were growing in their pots or rootball (if B&B). Best regards, Sandy\nUser: I may be guilty of putting them a little too deep. Regarding the soil, I know there is some heavy clay deep. But I did dig a hole larger than the root ball and placed a lot of good soil around it. What would your recommendations be to save them? Or is it too late?"

First, consider gently lifting the plants to ensure they are not planted too deeply. The top of the root ball should be level with or slightly above the surrounding soil. This can help prevent root rot and improve drainage. Additionally, ensure that the area around the plants is well-mulched, but keep the mulch away from the trunk to prevent moisture buildup. Water the plants deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth, especially during dry spells. If the soil is heavy clay, consider amending it with organic matter to improve drainage. Lastly, monitor the plants for any signs of pests or diseases, and prune any dead or diseased branches to encourage new growth. With these steps, you may be able to improve the health of your cherry laurels.\"}"

Unfortunately, the tall fescue grass is throughout my backyard lawn. Is it possible that it could be the result of seeding with poor quality lawn seed? or from some other way? I don't like the idea of using glyphosate because I have a dog and he occassionally eats grass. Not to mention that it would kill the good grass. Guess my only option is to pull/dig it out.

Since you prefer not to use chemicals, you can manage tall fescue by regularly mowing to prevent seed formation and manually removing clumps. Overseeding with a more desirable grass type can also help outcompete the tall fescue over time. Additionally, maintaining a healthy lawn through proper fertilization and watering can reduce the spread of unwanted grasses.\"}"

Any ideas what could cause that kind of sudden change? Does it look like it can be revived? If so, any suggestions?\nExpert: Hi, Jordan - wow, that's a distressed tree.  We've had some extreme heat lately, so it could be the tree wasn't receiving the water and care it needed while you were away.  It's hard to diagnose, just from pictures - but you could certainly bring in a branch with both alive and dead needles attached for us to diagnose. There is a $7 charge, but it might be worth it. Has there been herbicide-usage in the area? Has the tree been receiving the amount of water it's used to getting?  Our diagnosticians are still accepting samples from 8-4, M-F in our office at 9595 Nelson Rd in Longmont.  You also could just take special care of the tree over the fall and winter, giving it some water throughout until Spring and see if it survives.  Good luck, it's heartbreaking to lose a tree. Deb C.\nUser: Hello, Avery, Thank you for the quick response! The two weeks we were gone were some of the hottest days this summer (last week of July into early the second week of August), so that certainly could be a factor. We do have a drip system for most of our landscaping, but it's possible it needs some maintenance where the tree is located. We will look into it.  As for herbicide-usage, we and/or our landscaper have not used any this summer. The only recent addition was pine bark mulch to the area around the tree. That was done just a week or so before we left. Yes, we could certainly bring over a sample next week. I'm assuming y'all are away on Monday for Labor Day, but we could get you a sample likely on Tuesday. Cheers, Richard\nExpert: Hi, Jordan,  Just following-up for Deb. Yes, we were closed on Monday.

Make sure the cylinders are not too tight around the plants to allow for growth.\\n\\n3. **Scent-Based Repellents**: The 'Liquid Fence' product you have is a popular choice. Apply it regularly, especially after rain, as it can wash away. It's also a good idea to rotate different types of repellents to prevent rabbits from getting used to one scent.\\n\\n4. **Additional Measures**: Consider planting rabbit-resistant plants such as lavender, marigolds, or alliums around the perimeter of your garden as a natural deterrent.\\n\\n5. **Regular Monitoring**: Keep an eye on your garden and reapply or adjust your methods as needed. \\n\\nIf you continue to have issues, you might want to consult with a local extension service or a professional for more tailored advice.

        "value": "<image>\n<image>\n<image>\nUser: Two years ago we paid $1000 to have a Brandywine crabapple tree planted in our front yard. Within the first few months, some of the tree's branches developed yellow leaves and then died. I cut off the dead branches and the tree seemed to survive but did not exhibit any new growth. For the next two springs, the tree initially seemed healthy and produced a lot of flowers. However, each year, once the flowers were gone, the tree immediately started developing yellow leaves and dying branches and showed little sign of any new growth. This same phenomenon is happening again this year. And while the tree is not totally dead, more branches are being removed each year with little to no growth coming to replace them. So the tree's days seem numbered. \n\nDo you have any idea of what the problem might be with this tree?  Is there any hope for it? I have attached a few pictures of the tree in its current state. Any advice you could provide would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThanks, Jordan C.\nExpert: Thank you for reaching out to the Extension office. Your pictures are very helpful. We have some suggestions and a few more questions as well. First what we have noticed from your pictures. 1. Are these pictures from last year? We have noticed the crabapples on the tree. 2. There appears to be discoloration at the base of the trunk. Is this wet? Soft?  3. How often is the tree watered? How deep is the mulch?  4. Gently pull the mulch back from the tree trunk. Can you see the flare outward to the soil? If so, the mulch would be better to be moved back toward the drip line of the tree. Are the roots surface and appear to be circling the tree or extending outward? 5. CSU recommends that tree supports be removed after one year. The cells in the tree will mature and give natural stability to the tree. 6. We have noticed quite a few scars on the trunk extending up the tree. Is this possibly hail damage from previous years or other injury you are aware of? Or were they present when the tree was purchased? 7. What is the sun exposure to this tree? Wind? 8. What is on the other side of this tree? In the foreground. Is there unobstructed turf/lawn? 9. Did you winter water the tree? Was there snow and/or ice pack at the base of the tree? 10. Is there landscape fabric under the mulch? This is quite a number of questions but your answers will help us figure out what is going on with the tree.  We will look forward to your reply!  Thank you, Avery and Courtney Cahill Arapahoe County Master Gardeners\nUser: Dear, Avery and Courtney, Thanks for the quick reply to my inquiry. Below I have provided answers to your questions. Please let me know if you need anything more.1. Are these pictures from last year? We have noticed the crabapples on the tree.    No. The pictures are current. They were taken on the same day that I sent the inquiry email. So far, each spring the tree has developed leaves and flowers and looks healthy. But once the flowers die, the yellow leaves start to appear and branches start dying off.2. There appears to be discoloration at the base of the trunk. Is this wet? Soft? There is a story behind that discoloration. I will try to be brief. The tree was planted by the nursery that sold us the tree. They did not provide any mulch so we added some mulch a couple weeks later. The mulch was probably about 1 - 2 inches deep. I specifically tried to keep all the mulch about 4 inches away from the base  of the tree. Over time, some of it settled back around the base but it was very shallow (1/2 inch or less). The tree was left this way from  June of 2021 until February of this year.Early this year, as my concern about the tree increased, I started reading things online and found the info about the flare at the base of the tree needing to be at or slightly above ground level. So in late February I took a close look at the base and did not see a flare. I started to dig down until I found the place where the base seemed to be flaring out. I then removed all mulch and dirt down to that level in a 4 foot circle around the tree. I  replaced a thin layer of mulch (~1 inch) around the perimeter of the tree trying to keep most of it away from the base.The bottom line is that the discoloration you are referring to shows the level to which the trunk was buried in dirt by the original planters. Note that this part has been UNBURIED since early this year - back when it was still winter, but the discoloration is still there. It doesn't feel particularly wet or soft right now.3. How often is the tree watered? How deep is the mulch? From late spring to early fall the tree was getting a very tiny amount of water on a daily basis from a drip system. That was probably 5 minutes a day at a 4 gph flow rate. Throughout the hot months I would usually give it a good soaking one a week or so. Through the winter, I gave it a moderate watering about once per month if we didn't get any snow/rain that month.As stated above, for most of the time the mulch has been around 2 inches deep and mostly kept away from the base of the tree. Currently it is less than 1 inch deep. The small amounts seen near the base now are just scrap remnants from when I cleared all the dirt away back in February.4. Gently pull the mulch back from the tree trunk. Can you see the flare outward to the soil? If so, the mulch would be better to be moved back toward the drip line of the tree. Are the roots surface and appear to be circling the tree or extending outward?I have pulled the mulch back and taken a picture (see attachment). I can't see a lot of roots but I don't see any circling the tree. To further clarify the situation, I used a hose to blast away some of the dirt around the base to provide a better picture of the root situation (see attachment). 5. CSU recommends that tree supports be removed after one year. The cells in the tree will mature and give natural stability to the tree.Noted. It has been almost 2 years so I will remove the stakes.6. We have noticed quite a few scars on the trunk extending up the tree. Is this possibly hail damage from previous years or other injury you are aware of? Or were they present when the tree was purchased?Unfortunately we did not pay close enough attention to notice whether those scars were present at planting. I am certain that we have not had any hail that was anywhere NEAR big enough to create scars of that size (we have only had a few occurrences of pea-sized hail). I am not aware of anything else physical that would have caused them. 7. What is the sun exposure to this tree? Wind?The tree is planted in front of our house which is facing east. It gets pretty full sun exposure until late afternoon when the house blocks out the late-day sun (6pm?). 8. What is on the other side of this tree? In the foreground. Is there unobstructed turf/lawn?I have attached a photo to provide a clearer picture of the tree's position and surroundings. The other small tree right next to it is a remnant from a different crabapple that was growing in this space many years ago. It sprouted around the time this tree was planted. I've been so concerned about our new tree the whole time that I decided to let it keep growing. This way, if our existing  tree dies I can transplant this remnant as its replacement (at least it has proven that IT can survive there).9. Did you winter water the tree? Was there snow and/or ice pack at the base of the tree?Yes. When we did not get snow for a month or more I would give it a light watering. When there were heavy snows, snow removed from the driveway would get piled up around this tree. It would usually be gone within a week or two. 10. Is there landscape fabric under the mulch?No fabric is underneath.On Mon, Jun 5, 2023 at 1:49 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: Dear, Jordan,  Trees need air (carbon dioxide) to survive as much as they need water. The roots of a tree need to be in the first 12\" of the soil (6\" for some trees like maples).   It seems that this tree is struggling for air. It was really good that you removed the mulch and dug down a bit. (But this diagnosis is only an educated guess from photos and details you have provided.)  Do you remember how deep the roots were planted? Generally we tell people that the tree needs to be planted on a donut shaped hole, with a mound in the center. The root ball sits on top of the mound, while the roots are draped into the dug out, outer circle. The root ball is supposed to stick out of the ground slightly.  I am going to see if I can find information on how to remedy girdled roots in a young tree. Roots are a big deal. A majority of issues with trees are root related.   You said the tree was planted two years ago. Was this spring of 2021?   Best regards,  Brenda Francis  (There are different Master Gardener volunteers in the office every day. We all work with the same email inbox and have very similar training.)\nUser: It was planted in June of 2021.So are you able to rule out disease/fungus as the issue?On Thu, Jun 8, 2023, 11:20 AM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

The fact that the root flare was buried could have contributed to the tree's struggle for air and nutrients. While disease or fungus cannot be entirely ruled out without further testing, the symptoms and history suggest that root issues are a significant factor. It would be beneficial to consult with a local arborist who can perform a more thorough examination, including checking for any signs of disease or fungus. Additionally, you might consider reaching out to the nursery that sold you the tree to discuss any potential recourse, especially if the planting was done by them. They may offer a warranty or replacement policy. In the meantime, continue to ensure proper watering and avoid piling mulch against the trunk to allow the roots to breathe.\"}"

Shredding the leaves can help them decompose faster, which can improve soil health and make it easier for water and nutrients to reach the roots of your plants. It also helps prevent the leaves from matting, which can block air and water from reaching the soil. On the other hand, leaving the leaves whole can provide better insulation for the soil during the winter months and can be beneficial for overwintering insects. Since you have a variety of plants, including those that thrive in different conditions, you might consider a mixed approach: shred some leaves to use around plants that prefer well-drained soil and leave others whole in areas where you want to provide more insulation. This way, you can enjoy the benefits of both methods.\"}"

Additionally, the presence of other trees nearby could be creating competition for nutrients and water, even though you mentioned the tree gets plenty of water. The loamy soil with clay underneath is generally good for cedars, but ensure that the soil is not compacted, which could affect root growth and water absorption. Since you mentioned the possibility of poisoning, you might want to consider having a soil test done to check for any unusual chemicals or toxins. Also, ensure that the tree is not suffering from root rot, which can occur in overly wet conditions. Pruning any dead or diseased branches and ensuring proper air circulation can also help. If possible, try to gradually increase the amount of sunlight the tree receives by trimming back the boxelder or other nearby vegetation.

I have a tendency to kill plants but I really need to improve my landscaping!!\nExpert: Hi, Casey a few questions to help you select an appropriate shrub for your landscaping. 1)  Are you looking for a shrub that would be stand alone or ones that would grow together to form a hedge? 2) When you say plant by your house do you mean right up next to it?  (This will help decide since some shrubs grow quite wide without lots of pruning and maintenance.) 3) What is your location (City or area of the county) and how much sun exposure would it get?  (North, West, South or East side of the house)  By narrowing down the site specifics we can help select something that would have a higher chance of surviving there and hopefully help you become a more successful plant owner.\nUser: Hi, Riley, Thanks for getting back to me so quickly! To answer your questions:    1)  Are you looking for a shrub that would be stand alone or ones that would grow together to form a hedge?     Preferably I'd like them to grow together into a hedge!    2) When you say plant by your house do you mean right up next to it?  (This will help decide since some shrubs grow quite wide without lots of pruning and maintenance.)  Yes, right up against the house - I have a corner lot and while it has yet to be an issue I remain concerned about people just walking on up to my windows and looking in! (We get a lot of 'wanderers' from a nearby shelter in our neighborhood.)    3) What is your location (City or area of the county) and how much sun exposure would it get?  (North, West, South or East side of the house)  I'm in Coos Bay on the far west side, the bushes would be facing East at the front of the home. It gets a lot of light until around 1:00pm!    If you need to know anything else just let me know!!     Mia Fisher, MSW, LCSW, CAGCS Manager, Family Services South Coast Hospice & Palliative Care (O)<personal data hidden> (C)<personal data hidden>        From: ask=<personal data hidden> <ask=<personal data hidden>> on behalf of Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> Sent: Wednesday, March 22, 2023 1:09 PM To: Mia Fisher <<personal data hidden>> Subject: Re: What Type Of Shrub Would Work?

What should I do to prevent in speed of this insect\nExpert: Tree of Heaven (Ailanthus), is the preferred host plant for the invasive Spotted Lanternfly, so it is not surprising that the insect is flocking to your tree. You can learn more about this new pest here:  https://extension.umd.edu/resource/spotted-lanternfly-home-gardens/ Now that it has arrived, we are finding that Spotted Lanternfly is not as serious as we once thought it might be. Like the Brown Marmorated Stinkbug years ago, it is expected to be a nuisance pest for a while but we are already seeing our birds, insects and wildlife finding them tasty and helping with control. The areas where they first arrived in Maryland in large numbers are not seeing near as many now. For that reason we are not recommending any pesticides be applied in home landscapes.  Perhaps one of the best things you can consider doing is have the Tree of Heaven removed. You can't just cut them down as they respond by sending roots out in all directions and you may end up with a plantation of them. There is more info on how to get rid of them (from Penn State) at this link here: https://extension.umd.edu/resource/tree-heaven/ The timeframe to follow those directions is now through leaf coloring in the fall.   Christine\nUser: Thank you for this information.  I have also read about a circle trap to put on the tree that is invested & it traps & kills the fly. Is this worth the effort? My tree is covered with the mature flies & they are excreting the honeydew, but its not in a central area of my yard.  I can kill the tree as recommended.  But when it's dead in the fall & I have it cut down - won't it still have the eggs to worry about destroying?

These traps are designed to capture and kill the insects as they move up and down the tree. While it may not completely eliminate the problem, it can help manage the population and reduce the amount of honeydew excreted. Regarding your concern about eggs, it's important to inspect the tree for egg masses before removal. These can be scraped off and destroyed to prevent hatching. After the tree is cut down, continue to monitor the area for any new growth or egg masses, as the Tree of Heaven can resprout and potentially harbor more Spotted Lanternflies. Combining these methods with the eventual removal of the tree should help manage the pest effectively.\"}"

I am including some information from Davy Tree about care and watering of Japanese Maple .  If possible, get back with me on the planting location and sun exposure of the plant and I may be able to research more deeply for you. But I do believe this may be the cause of the difficulty https://blog.davey.com/what-is-deep-root-watering-of-a-tree/ https://blog.davey.com/see-burnt-tree-leaves-fix-leaf-scorch-symptoms-with-treatment/ https://blog.davey.com/what-to-do-when-your-japanese-maple-has-crispy-or-brown-leaves/#:\nUser: Thank you for your detailed reply. I really appreciate it.  The attached links were very helpful.    I did notice that the tree has some leaves that have white spots. I was able to remove it with my finger, so I'm guessing it's mildew.  As for the location you are correct.  It's probably getting too much afternoon sun. However, the length of time it is exposed it's not long. I think it may be drying out the way everything else is in the yard.   We're going to try a very slow  water.   I will forward a picture of the leaves with spots.   Laura Nolan On Jun 8, 2023, at 6:43 AM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:﻿\nUser: On Jun 9, 2023, at 8:30 PM, Laura Nolan <<personal data hidden>> wrote:﻿Thank you for your detailed reply.

The curled and blackened edges could indeed be due to leaf scorch from too much sun exposure, especially if the tree is getting more afternoon sun than it can handle. Your plan to provide slow watering is excellent, as Japanese maples prefer consistent moisture. The recent rain will also help alleviate any drought stress. \\n\\nRegarding the white spots that you could remove with your finger, it does sound like it could be powdery mildew. This is a common issue in humid conditions and can be managed by ensuring good air circulation around the tree and avoiding overhead watering. If the problem persists, you might consider using a fungicide specifically labeled for powdery mildew on Japanese maples. \\n\\nKeep monitoring the tree's condition, and if you notice any further issues, feel free to reach out for more advice. Your proactive approach to care is commendable!\"}"

        "value": "User: Yesterday, I was removing a dead storm damaged branch.  I didn't realize that it was still attached to a very much alive 21/2 inch limb and a strip of bark came off with it.  The strip is one half inch by fourteen inches.  Do I need to prune this branch back to the next limb?  And while I have your attention, there is a Sycamore \"seedling\" about a foot and one half feet tall. I would like to transplant this.  When is the best time of year to do this?\n\nThank you, Jordan\nExpert: Richard, The stripped bark should cause little damage other than cosmetic. I would keep an eye on the spot until it ages and watch for insect damage.    As regards to the Sycamore seedling, now would be a great time to transplant it.  Fall is best because the roots will get well established through the winter. One caution: If we go back to dry weather don't forget to keep it watered even as the weather cools.    Thank you for the question and I hope you have a great fall and a healthy and happy holiday season.\nUser: Thank you very much Dan.  I couldn't hope for a better answer! RichardOn Fri, Oct 4, 2024 at 10:38 AM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: Richard,   Next spring will tell if there was any serious damage. If it leaves out, but then the leaves wilt and die, you will probably have to remove the damaged branch. Most likely, that won't happen and you won't have any problems.     In the future, with larger limbs, use the 'three cut' method where you make your first cut under the damaged branch an inch or two out from the trunk. This cut is only an inch or so deep, but then when you make your full cut out from there, if it tears the bark as it falls, the tear will stop at that first under cut. The third cut is at the branch collar and the tree will then heal itself.    Enjoy the season.\nUser: Thank you for the information.  Pruning is not my strong suit and I will take your advice.

Should I be concerned?\nExpert: Given how young and newly planted your Sweetbay Magnolia is, we think it looks pretty well! (The little one I planted last season has no leaves at all but I am hoping for a new flush of green soon).  It appears that a small amount of leaves are affected, and the others look healthy. The most important thing you can do for your new tree is to keep it watered when needed for the whole first 18-24 months of establishment. Here is the best way to do that:  https://extension.umd.edu/resource/watering-trees-and-shrubs/  Make sure your mulch is not deeper than about 3-4 inches and keep it pulled away from contact with the trunk. If you have deer in your area a tall, staked round of metal fencing is helpful.   Christine\nUser: Thank you, Avery.

It only started appearing in the last few weeks, after fruit was set. I noticed black mite-like bugs on the pictured plants (but not other plants) earlier in the season and took care of them with a strong hose blast and neem oil.

I have similar leaf discoloration on zucchini, marigolds, and dahlias, but peppers, cornflowers, and cucumbers unaffected so far. All plants being grown in fairly close proximity in separate containers. I use neem oil as a pesticide and miracle grow powder (mixes into water) fertilizer. Do I need to destroy affected plants?

If I plant Lilly of the Valley am I trading one invasive for another?\nExpert: Hi, Skyler, Thank you for contacting the UVM Extension Master Gardener Helpline with your question. Lily of the Valley can spread similarly with underground rhizomes but it is not in the same invasive category as chervil. Lily of the Valley does well as a shade plant and can therefore be a very effective ground cover in such areas. I have it in my garden. You can construct an underground barrier to keep it confined but by the nature of your question, I think you are looking to have it spread widely in the area previously occupied by the chervil. If you decide you have too many Lily of the Valley plants, you can dig them up, but make sure you wear gloves since they can cause skin irritation. I am including several references: https://vtinvasives.org/invasive/wild-chervilto help you in removing the chervil https://www.uvm.edu/sites/default/files/Extension-Community-Horticulture/Best_Plants_for_30_Tough_Sites_UMN.pdf to show the recommendation of Lily of the Valley as a ground cover and https://www.thenews-messenger.com/story/news/2020/08/03/master-gardener-heres-how-keep-lily-valley-under-control/<personal data hidden>/ which is a very good article written by a Master Gardener to assist with help in controlling the spread of Lily of the Valley if you find you need that.

Overall, there's no need to be concerned about having Roly Poly bugs in your compost.\"}"

Could you possibly give me some advice? I attach a photo.\nExpert: Unfortunately we can't see much detail in the photo, but can say that several environmental factors and a couple minor pests or diseases can cause yellowing/browning of foliage. Is the plant located in partial shade or mostly sun? If the latter, it might be getting sun-scalded. Do the leaves appear to be finely stippled, where their color is faded a bit or the leaves have a slightly grainy appearance? If so, mite feeding damage might be the cause, though these are not common pests on Camellia.  Is the soil well-drained and is the plant being monitored for watering needs given our current drought? While Camellias are sensitive to their roots staying too wet, they also have limited tolerance for root drying if the soil a few inches deep into the root zone isn't moist enough.  Is there mulch around the plant's base? If so, is it piled against the stem bases or is there a gap for air circulation? Over-mulching can interfere with root oxygen and moisture availability, and too much mulch touching plant stems risk damage to the bark from trapped moisture or animals sheltering in the mulch that could chew into the wood. We don't suspect the latter in this case since much more foliage would probably be dying off, but a heavy mulch layer (if present) should be reduced to about two or three inches at the maximum and not touching the bark.  Any other information about its growing conditions or recent history (was anything sprayed on or near the plant before it browned?) can help us narrow-down a diagnosis. If you are able to share close-up photos of its leaf symptoms (check the leaf undersides as well for insects like Cottony Camellia Scale) that would also be helpful.  Miri\nUser: Dear, Charlie,  Thank you very much. I will examine the leaves more closely with this information in hand. -Judy\nExpert: You're welcome.\nUser: Dear, Charlie,  The camellia at my house I wrote about some time ago appears to be ailing even more now, and I think I should hire an expert to come look at it and give counsel. Are you able to recommend a person or a company? My neighborhood has people certified as master gardeners, but they know flowers and ferns. The tree company I have used (Bartlett) focuses on the pruning and removal of trees. I would like to find someone who knows camellias and could tell me how to help this shrub or what I might replace it with if it can't be saved.   Advice would be much appreciated. Sincerely,Judy"

To address this, you can reduce the frequency of watering. Instead of watering every other day, try watering deeply once a week. This allows the soil to dry out between waterings, which is crucial for preventing root rot. As for the iron chelate application, it is generally recommended to apply it once every 1-2 years in the spring when the leaves emerge, rather than monthly. This is because excessive iron can also cause issues. Adjusting these aspects of your care routine should help your tree recover. However, if the condition does not improve, it may be beneficial to consult a local arborist for a more detailed assessment.\"}"

Here are some strategies you can try to manage and eventually eradicate bindweed from your lawn:\\n\\n1. **Consistent Mowing:** Regular mowing can help weaken bindweed by preventing it from flowering and setting seed. Keep your lawn mowed to a height of about 3 inches to encourage healthy grass growth, which can outcompete the bindweed.\\n\\n2. **Mulching:** In areas where bindweed is particularly dense, consider using a thick layer of mulch to smother the weeds. This is more effective in garden beds than in lawns.\\n\\n3. **Herbicides:** Since you've already tried some herbicides, consider using a systemic herbicide that targets broadleaf weeds. Glyphosate is a non-selective herbicide that can be effective, but it will also kill grass, so it should be applied carefully. Alternatively, selective herbicides that target broadleaf weeds without harming grass can be used.\\n\\n4. **Manual Removal:** Continue to pull bindweed regularly, especially after rain when the soil is moist, making it easier to remove more of the root system.\\n\\n5. **Improve Lawn Health:** Aerate your lawn and apply a balanced fertilizer to promote healthy grass growth, which can help outcompete the bindweed.\\n\\n6. **Professional Help:** If the problem persists, consider consulting a local lawn care professional or your local Cooperative Extension office for more targeted advice.\\n\\nPersistence is key with bindweed, as it can take several seasons to fully eradicate it.

Also, in what type of vegetation community is your property? (forest, grass/shrubland, proximity to wetland or riparian area) If moles are at work, they can be tunneling without making frequent molehills - which are in part just ways to dispose of excess dirt from tunneling, so you may in fact be seeing surface evidence of a mole at work. Depending on the vegetation community in which your property occurs, vole species in your county could include long-tailed (no burrows), montane (runways in grassland), or sagebrush (clusters of burrows) - all of them are herbivorous.  If you can please send photos, perhaps I can be of more help in id'ing who you've got there. Also keep watch for other sign (such as rabbit pellets) and creatures at night, too (e.g., slugs), which might be providing some of the effects you're noticing.\nUser: I unfortunately do not have any photos at this time, cause I stepped on the runways in the flowerbeds to settle the flowers back in.

We are in a cul-de-sac of houses and our front yard has two maple trees with flower beds under them and then a long flower bed in an L shape with a Japanese maple at the end of the L. It is the front flower beds (L shaped and under maples) that I have seen the ridged tunnels. Kinda reminds me when baking a cake or loaf of banana bread, when done it  is raised with a crack running through it. I will check again tomorrow to see if any new tunnels have shown up and try to get photos. No plant damage I can see, but have seen a couple times some small holes, but not that close to the tunnels.

Given the dry weather you've mentioned, it's possible that the tree is experiencing some stress due to lack of water. However, since you've also noted issues with aphids on your tulip poplars, it's worth considering that aphids or other pests might be affecting your beech tree as well.\\n\\nI recommend closely inspecting the leaves and branches for any signs of pests, such as sticky residue or the presence of insects. If pests are present, you might consider using a horticultural oil or insecticidal soap to manage them. If the issue seems more related to environmental stress, ensuring the tree receives adequate water, especially during dry spells, can help. Mulching around the base of the tree can also help retain soil moisture.\\n\\nIf the problem persists or worsens, consulting with a local arborist or extension service for a more detailed assessment might be beneficial.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n[Your Name]\"}"

        "value": "User: Hello,  I have a small pinyon and an ash that have signs of bore holes on them, as well as a maple that has been showing signs of Chlorosis. I talked with my household about treatment options and got some quotes from arborists. We decided that we didn't want to go with permethrin treatment yet, but would like to try any other treatment we can for boosting the health of the trees, as our understanding is that the borers will take out the tree when it's already stressed by other factors, and we'd like to just keep the trees healthy and resilient. I did some homework on extension and other places and decided to go with an FeEDDHA chelated iron for the maple treatment. I am also winter watering the trees to boost overall health. In addition to those, I wanted to see if there are other recommendations for products or treatments I could do myself to help proactively boost the general health and resilience of the evergreens (juniper, spruce, pinyon, ponderosa) and the ash. Soil supplements? Fertilizers? Others?  Thank you, Cameron\nExpert: Hi, Cameron,  Are the borer holes in your ash round? Can you see them at eye level and below? If so, this is likely lilac ash borer (not emerald ash borer) and this is a pest that is linked to tree stress (drought, pruning, storm damage, improper planting, etc.). Lilac ash borer is not a killing insect - so good cultural practices should be practiced in order to boost overall tree health. This includes proper watering (including winter watering, like you're doing), good pruning cuts, avoiding string trimmer injury at the base of the tree, etc.  What type of maple do you have? Yes, the EDDHA iron chelate is the best option for high pH soils - but you can also adjust cultural practices by alleviating compaction, reducing water (to avoid soggy soils), and focusing on best management practices. Unfortunately most maples just don't do well in our soils and often get chlorosis.  As for the pinon, it's hard to guess what might be causing the damage. Is it the tips of branches? The trunk or crotch angles? I don't feel confident recommending any treatments until I have more information.   In general, trees and shrubs don't need much fertilization or nutrients. Our soils, though clay-ey, provide much of the nutrients they need. Focusing on cultural practices is often the best approach - proper water, making good pruning cuts, planting the right species, planting at the proper depth, etc.\nUser: So sorry for all the messages, this one actually includes the additional pictures, I shouldn't be doing emails at this time of night :)On Mon, Mar 20, 2023, 10:00 PM David Pinto <<personal data hidden>> wrote:The first message was missing a couple pictures of the pinon, and I believe any damage would have been the trunk that the arborist was indicating. On Mon, Mar 20, 2023, 10:00 PM David Pinto <<personal data hidden>> wrote:Thanks, Morgan,On Mon, Mar 13, 2023, 1:53 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nUser: The first message was missing a couple pictures of the pinon, and I believe any damage would have been the trunk that the arborist was indicating. On Mon, Mar 20, 2023, 10:00 PM David Pinto <<personal data hidden>> wrote:Thanks, Morgan,On Mon, Mar 13, 2023, 1:53 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

Based on the symptoms you've described—spots on the leaves, drooping branches, and leaf drop—your aspen trees might be suffering from a fungal disease such as Marssonina leaf spot, which is common in aspens. This disease can cause leaf spots and premature leaf drop, especially in wet conditions. To manage this, ensure good air circulation around the trees by pruning any overcrowded branches and removing any fallen leaves to reduce the spread of the fungus. Additionally, avoid overhead watering to keep the foliage dry. For severe cases, you might consider applying a fungicide labeled for use on aspens, but it's best to consult with a local arborist or extension service for specific recommendations. If the problem persists, a professional assessment might be necessary to rule out other issues such as root rot or pest infestations. I hope this helps, and please feel free to reach out if you have further questions.\"}"

However, your concern about Kentucky Blue Grass regrowing is valid, as it can be quite persistent. Using a non-selective herbicide like glyphosate can be effective in killing the grass roots. Glyphosate is generally considered safe for the soil and does not have long-term effects, allowing you to plant new vegetation a few days after application. On the other hand, vinegar-based sprays are less effective on established grasses like Kentucky Blue Grass, as they primarily affect the foliage and not the roots. If you choose glyphosate, ensure you follow the label instructions carefully. After treatment, monitor the area for any regrowth and reapply if necessary before planting your new plants. This approach should help you manage the grass and prepare the area for your new low-maintenance landscape.\"}"

I thought it might be too much water so I stopped watering for about 3 days. They are in the same shape and looking very poorly,  I put new soil on the bed this spring. It was a 50/50 mixture from a local yard and garden. I had the soil tested and it showed that it was low in N.  Boron was also low. This was a top dressing of about 6 inches. I'm afraid I will lose my whole crop this year. What are your suggestions? Your help/suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Jordan\nExpert: Hi, Jordan, There are a couple of possibilities that resemble the closeup photo with the curled leaves. My first thought is accidental exposure to an herbicide, such as 2,4,D--tomatoes are very sensitive to it and it will be a very visible effect in the leaves twisting.  Pesticides like 2,4 D ester are used to control broadleaf weeds and in many cases are used when glyphosate is no longer effective.  2,4,D can volatize, especially on hot days and by many accounts  is  highly prone to drift via spray droplets, vapor or gas on air currents.  It could have originated from an application on weeds several feet away or a few miles depending on the  atmospheric conditions.  Depending on where the soil you used and if it was mixed with manures for enrichment, there can be herbicides that pass through grazing animals into manure that can damage plants.  My understanding is that Maryland doesn't allow this herbicide spraying of hay fields. The effect is very severs twisting and thickening of leaves and stems. From the one picture, I don't see that level of severity.  Broad mites can cause curling leaves and attack peppers too (same family),  but they will also cause a bronzing effect is you have a bad infestation.  PLus, it seems to be more often high tunnel growers seeing this in Maryland.  Do any other plants in the garden also show unusual growth habits (twisted, dwarfed)  or do you only have tomatoes? If you had closeups of the lower parts of the tomato plants stems and older leaves that might reveal more. At this time though, , gut level response is that it is herbicide which will set plants back, weakening them and have less than a great harvest.\nUser: Thank you for your quick response. I have not ussed any pesticides on the tomato plants except seven dust (once).I had put a weed and feed on my grass on the other side of the yard in the early spring - I have a 1 acre lot. There is no bronzing on the leaves. I have tomatoes in a different garden and they are doing the same curling.I have lost a few pepper plants in a bed adjacent to the tomatoes. I will send you some photos of the lower stems and one of the pepper that is dieing.  Well, I’m not so good at putting pictures in my message (4 of the same one lol)  but it will hopefully give you  an idea of my problem. I made a few raised beds this spring with  peppers & broccoli with the same 50/50 mix and they are doing fine.Thanks, Taylor 8, 2024, at 11:53 AM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

Since you mentioned that the raised beds with the same soil mix are doing fine, it might be worth considering environmental factors such as watering practices and sun exposure. Increasing watering and using shade cloth, as you mentioned, could help alleviate stress on the plants. Additionally, consider applying a balanced fertilizer to address the nutrient deficiencies.

I can hardly go outside without being attacked by chiggers on my arms and legs. Also I've researched the itchy areas on my upper body that appear to have central pimples as I've seen described in regard to oak itch mites. Is it possible that they are running out of food on the leaves and are falling so early? Also, unfortunately, the oaks are growing so close together that I'm sure oak wilt disease is weakening some of them. And then there are effects of climate change and they mention effects of cicada cycles.So I ask is it possible that oak itch mites are appearing en masse nearly 2 months early?

I have always thought of them as little rattles because you can hear the seeds inside when you shake them.  The leaves look like they may have powdery mildew on them. Is this on the north or east side of the house? Baptisia should be in mostly sun conditions. Do you water overhead? These probably don't need to be irrigated much unless you just planted them this year. If you do need to supplement water, try to water at the base and not get the leaves wet.  Just monitor for symptoms and see if anything changes.  Let us know if you have further questions or send in more photos.  Emily\nUser: Hello, Peyton face south, so they get full sun.

While it's a bit difficult to see detail in the close-up of the leaves and insects, it is an elm tree which makes me think the insect may be the European elm flea weevil, European Elm Flea Weevil | Ohioline (osu.edu). The factsheet provides some information about treatment but also recommends contacting your local, Franklin County extension agent. Alternatively, you could contact Curtis Young in Van Wert County who wrote the article or Joe Boggs in Hamilton County who is an entomologist. You may want to contact Franklin County Urban Forestry since the tree appears to be on public property. Typically, the county urban forestry department is responsible for health and management of trees on public property. Good luck.\nUser: Thanks for the information.  I agree that the tree is most likely an elm and apologies for not getting a better picture.Also, it is a tree that was planted by the city.I also need to apologize for calling the things on the leaves bugs.  Now that I've looked a bit closer, they appear to be more like growths and not bugs.  I took a look at the European elm weavil you had described.  I didn't directly observe anything that looked like that bug, just growths.  Also, given the number of growths on the leaves throughout the tree there were very few leaf holes.  There were some, but didn't seem to have the number or \"blotch mines\" as described here \"https://extension.umn.edu/yard-and-garden-insects/european-elm-flea-weevil\".  So apologies if this ended up being a red herring.If you believe it still could be the weevil, please let me know.I've seen people refer to them as galls.  What do you think?On Wed, May 29, 2024, 11:03 Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

Galls are abnormal growths that can be caused by various organisms, including insects, mites, fungi, and bacteria. In the case of elm trees, galls are often caused by insects or mites. While galls can be unsightly, they typically do not cause significant harm to the tree. \\n\\nPreventing galls can be challenging because the organisms that cause them are often present before the galls become visible. However, here are a few general tips:\\n\\n1. **Cultural Control**: Maintain tree health through proper watering, mulching, and fertilization. A healthy tree is better able to withstand and recover from gall formation.\\n\\n2. **Chemical Control**: Insecticides or miticides can sometimes be used to prevent galls, but timing is critical. They need to be applied before the gall-forming organisms become active, which is often early in the growing season. It's best to consult with a local extension agent or a professional arborist for specific recommendations and timing in your area.\\n\\n3. **Pruning**: If the galls are limited to a few branches, pruning and destroying the affected branches can help reduce the population of gall-forming organisms.\\n\\nSince the tree is on public property, you might want to coordinate with your local urban forestry department for any treatment or management plans. They may have specific protocols or resources available for managing tree health in public spaces.\"}"

Some day I hope to grow peppers in mass...\n\nThanks and have a great day!\n\nThanks and have a great day\nExpert: Hi, I'm sorry, this is an email service. If you want to talk to a master gardener in person, look for events where Anoka County Master Gardeners are answering questions. Here's their page: https://anokamastergardeners.org/ My suspicion is that plants were somehow infected with a leaf spot and the excessive rain helped it run wild. Peppers want heat, and we haven't had much of it this year. This may be bacterial leaf spot, which thrives in wet, humid weather.  https://extension.umn.edu/disease-management/bacterial-spot-tomato-and-pepper It would be wise to discard infected plants to save the rest. If you want to save plants that are mildly affected, pull off and bag the bad leaves and put them in the garbage. Also remove any dead leaves from the area.  I hope this helps. Good luck.\nUser: Hello, Jordan you for the insight and direction. You’ve confirmed my suspicions.   Have a great day!   SteveSent from my iPhone On Jun 19, 2024, at 10:08 PM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:   ﻿"

To prevent potato scab in the future, you can try the following strategies:\\n\\n1. **Soil pH Management**: Maintain a slightly acidic soil pH (around 5.0 to 5.5) as scab is less likely to develop in acidic conditions. You can lower soil pH by adding sulfur or using acidifying fertilizers.\\n\\n2. **Crop Rotation**: Avoid planting potatoes in the same location for consecutive years. Rotate with crops that are not susceptible to scab, such as corn or beans.\\n\\n3. **Resistant Varieties**: Consider planting scab-resistant potato varieties.\\n\\n4. **Moisture Management**: Ensure consistent soil moisture, especially during tuber formation, as dry conditions can exacerbate scab development.\\n\\n5. **Clean Seed Potatoes**: Use certified disease-free seed potatoes to reduce the risk of introducing scab into your garden.\\n\\nRegarding the tiny raised white spots, they could be a different issue, such as lenticels, which are natural openings in the potato skin that can become raised if the potatoes are grown in overly wet conditions. Ensuring proper drainage and avoiding overwatering can help manage this issue.\"}"

Since your dahlia is planted in finished compost, it should have a good base of nutrients, but adding a small amount of nitrogen could help address the yellowing if it's due to a deficiency. Be cautious not to over-fertilize, as this can lead to other issues. It's also great to hear that your dahlia is sending up buds, which is a positive sign. Keep monitoring the plant, and if the yellowing persists or worsens, consider checking for other potential stress factors such as pests or environmental conditions. Best of luck with your dahlia!\"}"

I bought two different kinds of blueberry bushes and planted them last fall: one was a vaccinium sunshine blue and the other was a chandler blueberry. The one on the right did not produce any berries, and looks really sad. Should I do something to the soil or do I need to add a specific kind of plant? The grapes were here when we moved in 3 years ago, and while leaves grow every year, they only produce a handful of small hard grapes and the leaves look like they are eaten by some kind of pest. Is this salvageable or should I plant something new? This garden gets afternoon sun. Thank you for any guidance!\nUser: Hello, one more question. I inherited this asparagus patch when I moved in three years ago. It had probably been established for 3-5 years before that. The first year we had a spring harvest that was pretty decent (and you can see how healthy the stalks were about this time last summer when I had to remove all these mushrooms growing underneath. I did not get much of a harvest this past spring, and the brown stalks are what the asparagus patch looks like now. Is there anything I can do for it at this stage to help have a better crop next spring? If some has died, can I add new asparagus to it at this stage or any companion crop that will help it grow better? Thanks\nExpert: Where are you in Orange County?  i recommend you schedule a home visit.  Blueberries require acid soil. I suggest you take soil samples to get a baseline and augment soil according to soil sample.  If you haven’t pruned your grapes, they won’t produce very well same for blueberries.  Call during work week to schedule appointment.  My cell is<personal data hidden>.  R/mart\nUser: Thanks so much! I tried calling the number you shared, but it wouldn't go through. I'd appreciate scheduling a home visit. Is there a cost associated with that? I live in Chapel Hill, NC. Thanks!"

We still a lot, however, it is not solid patches of  bentgrass, it is big areas  all mixed in with our good grass.    We are in  the process of the tenacity spraying again.\n I am wondering, is there anything we can do in addition to that?  Like some sort of pre-emergent to help stop it from growing/spreading before it gets to this point?  If so, what is it , where do we get it and when do we use it?\nExpert: Thanks for your question.  I've looked at your question history with our forum.  It would appear that you and bentgrass have had a long association!!  I can understand your frustration.  Before giving you my best shot as an answer for your recent question, I need a little more information from you. 1).  Past Master Gardeners have suggested that perhaps you have a crabgrass problem rather than a bent grass problem.  What is your thinking about this?  Have you tried any procedures directed towards the elimination of crabgrass?  If so, any success? 2).  In September 2023, it was recommended that you remove the top layer of turf and over seed with some other grass.  If you did you do this, what was the end result both last fall (2023) and this spring (2024)?  Any improvement? 3).  It would appear that the first timeTenacity was applied was last fall (2023) by your lawn service.  Correct?  Do you have any idea as to the number applications done last fall and if more than one, what were the time intervals between applications? 4).  Tenacity can also be used as a pre- emergent herbicide in early spring.  Have you ever tried Tenacity or any other pre-emergent herbicide in the spring. 5).  What's your best guess as to how long you have been having an issue with bentgrass.

You might also consider using a selective herbicide specifically targeting bentgrass, such as those containing fenoxaprop, but be sure to follow the label instructions carefully. Lastly, improving lawn drainage and reducing irrigation can help, as bentgrass thrives in moist conditions. You can find these products at most garden centers or online. It's best to apply them according to the seasonal guidelines provided on the product labels.\"}"

First, using a harrow and drag as you mentioned is a good approach. Multiple passes can help level the ground, but be cautious with deep holes to avoid equipment damage. You might also consider filling the larger holes with soil manually before dragging to ensure a more even surface. For forage options, consider planting species that are less attractive to gophers. Alfalfa and clover are often targeted by gophers, so you might try grasses like tall fescue or orchardgrass, which are generally less appealing to them. Additionally, maintaining a healthy pasture with diverse species can help reduce the impact of gopher activity. If possible, consult with a local forage specialist to tailor the overseeding to your specific conditions and climate. Good luck, and I hope these suggestions help mitigate the problem!\"}"

Since you have already pulled the small clumps in your yard, it's a good start. Pulling is most effective before the plants set seed, so doing it now is appropriate. For the larger areas, mowing or weed-whacking before seed set is a good strategy. Repeated mowing can weaken the plants over time. Cutting back a 3-foot section is helpful, and expanding this buffer zone could further reduce the spread into your yard. Since the land behind your property is county-owned, you might want to contact local authorities to see if they have any management plans for invasive species like Japanese Stiltgrass. Additionally, consider using a pre-emergent herbicide in early spring next year to prevent new seeds from germinating. Unfortunately, the presence of deer can complicate control efforts, as they can spread seeds. Regular monitoring and maintenance will be key in managing this invasive grass. Best of luck!\"}"

Since you've mentioned the cardboard method, here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:\\n\\n1. **Site Preparation:**\\n   - Mow the existing grass as short as possible.\\n   - Lay down cardboard over the entire area you want to convert. Overlap the edges to prevent grass from growing through.\\n   - Water the cardboard thoroughly to help it start breaking down.\\n\\n2. **Soil Preparation:**\\n   - After the cardboard has been in place for a few weeks and has started to decompose, you can add a layer of compost or topsoil on top. This will provide a good base for your seeds.\\n\\n3. **Seeding:**\\n   - Choose a seed mix that is suitable for your sunlight conditions. Since most of your area gets at least 6 hours of sunlight, a full-sun mix should work well, but consider a partial shade mix for the area near the fence.\\n   - Spread the seeds evenly over the prepared soil. You can lightly rake them in or press them into the soil to ensure good contact.\\n\\n4. **Watering:**\\n   - Water the area gently but thoroughly after seeding. Keep the soil moist until the seeds germinate and the seedlings are established.\\n\\n5. **Maintenance:**\\n   - Once established, native wildflower meadows require minimal maintenance. You may need to water during prolonged dry spells and remove any invasive weeds that appear.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you should be able to create a beautiful and sustainable wildflower meadow that will attract birds and butterflies to your garden.

They have tons of small sticker seeds along its many branches that are mature (dry). If I spray the plants with Roundup now, would that kill the seeds, hopefully? Thanks, Emerson\nWashington County Minnesota\n\nExpert Response\nAs long as they are not ripe and attached to the plant, yes roundup should kill the seeds too. The best thing to do if feasible would be to cut them off and bag the tops and treat the cut base immediately with roundup. Or mow after a couple of days to collect the seeds. There will also be a large seed bank in the ground to really reduce the numbers will take a couple of years. \nClaire Kari Replied September 08, 2021, 7:52 PM EDT\nExpert: Hi there!  Will Roundup (glyphosate) kill seeds on a standing plant? It depends on whether or not the seed is still attached to the plant in a vascular way. Is the seed still sharing fluid with the parent plant, or has it be excised, and it's just waiting to be blown away? If the seed coat is complete, and the fluid transfer has been cut off, it's unlikely that the application will kill the seed. It's possible of course, if the seed gets soaked with the product and it's able to penetrate the waxy seed-coat... but unlikely.   Seeds are built to last... complete with moisture barriers to prevent dessication (drying out). Some plants have stronger, heartier seeds than others, of course.   If weeds are already dropping seed, consider mowing & bagging. After that process, the plants will be more susceptible to a Roundup application because of the 'open wounds.'   Thanks for reaching out to Extension! Kaci\nUser: Thank you so much Kaci. Kind of what I was thinking (hoping). We don’t have a mow and bag option - we’re in rural forested area (no lawn), so have to just do the best we can over whatever area we are able.Take care.GloriaOn May 24, 2023, at 9:48 AM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

Given your situation in a rural forested area without the option to mow and bag, using Roundup sparingly and with precautions is understandable. As mentioned in the expert response you found, Roundup is unlikely to kill seeds that are mature and have detached from the plant, as they are designed to resist desiccation and have protective seed coats. However, if the seeds are still attached and vascularly connected to the plant, there is a chance that Roundup could affect them. Since you are dealing with Hairy Bittercress and poison oak, applying Roundup directly to the plants while they are still actively growing might help manage the spread, but it may not completely eliminate the seed bank in the soil. Continuous monitoring and repeated applications over time may be necessary to reduce the seed bank effectively. Consider integrating other management practices, such as manual removal where feasible, to complement the chemical control.\"}"

The group that did the treatment at the time thought they \"caught it early enough\" but I have seen more and more of signs of stress each of the past 3 years.\n\nThe signs of stress I see are limited new growth, yellowing of leaves, and now even a few larger branches that do not have leaves at all.\n\nDo you think it is time to remove this tree?\n\nI've attached a few pictures that show some of the stress I mentioned above.\n\nThis tree is about 23 years old.\n\nThank you for your advice.\nExpert: The older and more established a tree is, the less likely that treatment for SGRs will be successful.  Furthermore, treating SGRs amounts to excavating around the trunk and cutting roots. This should be done by an experienced certified arborist.  Larger roots, even if girdling, might supply a major part of a tree's nutrients.  Sometimes the treatment requires repeated pruning of the SGRs over a period of several years.  I am saying all this because, according to you, your tree was treated for SGRs when it was 19 years old.  So this was a problematic procedure, even if you used an experienced certified arborist.  I can't say whether to remove the tree or not.  It might be a hazard tree, since it sits alongside a road.  The original work may not have removed all the SGRs.  Or, if the work was done incorrectly, there may have been damage to the tree's vascular system.  In any case, you should have a certified arborist assess your tree: https://www.treesaregood.org/findanarborist  Here are some links to descriptions of SGRs and their treatment: https://www.purduelandscapereport.org/article/stem-girdling-roots/ https://yardandgarden.extension.iastate.edu/how-to/all-about-stem-girdling-roots https://conservancy.umn.edu/items/050ca7df-1d29-40be-9def-756a0567a038\nUser: Thank you for your feedback  Yes, this tree was treated by a certified group for SGRs.  They did as you described above...excavation of the trunk and root system and carefully cutting the troublesome roots.  At the time they said that the tree should be significantly larger than it was and that the SGRs were stunting the trees growth.  I have no doubt that SGRs are what is slowly killing this tree.  I think the amount of \"yellow leaves\" and \"dead branches\" has accelerated the last two years so my inclination is to have the tree removed.  At the time we had it treated the arborist said \"hopefully we treated it just in time\"...but as I have continued to see the tree's health decline the last two years I have my doubts.  I understand you cannot make a recommendation, but I'm hoping you can at least agree that the tree does not look healthy.  Thanks again!

I am a member of Colorado Native Plants Society, so I am definitely planting natives in those places that I am putting in new plants. However, the huge backyard already has a number of non-native plants that are coming up this spring.  I have been digging and removing those that I know are invasive, such as common burdock. However, I would like to leave those that are not particularly invasive, because I do not have time or the means to replace them this year. And they are serving a soil purpose as a ground cover. Specifically, can you tell me if madwort--asperugo procumbens is considered invasive in Fort Collins? How about prostrate knotweed, polygonum avunculare which I believe is native but perhaps considered invasive anyway. Creeping bellflower, campanulla rapunculoides? Ground elder, algopodium podegraria?  Sweet violet, viola odorata?  In a case where I don't really care if something takes over, can I keep it? Or is this a disservice to my neighbors? Thanks, JordanLou\nExpert: Hi, JordanLou,  I have provided (hopefully) the information you're seeking. None of the plants are Class A noxious weeds (which requires/mandates control). Of those you listed, the one that likely warrants control is the creeping bellflower. That said, people define weeds as a \"plant out of place\".   Please let me know if you have any follow-up questions: Prostate knotweed: annual weed, can be invasive, but generally grows in disturbed areas or lawns/beds without competition. It's almost always found in bare soil.Creeping bellflower: invasive perennial and should be controlled (that said, it's extremely difficult to control); sometimes called the \"Old Town Weed\". Usually requires chemistry for control (pulling is not very effective).Sweet violets are not considered invasive and many consider them to be an ornamental. They do self-seed, but they aren't difficult to control with pulling, hoeing, or mechanical removal. The Aegopodium (also called goutweed, Bishop's weed) is considered an ornamental perennial. It can become more aggressive if it's in an area that gets regular water. But in a dry site it can be an attractive shade ground cover.\nUser: Thanks—very helpful.

Is it too late to move it - considering it is mid June and a heatwave is scheduled for next week? Should I just douse it in water? I am afraid it might die.\nExpert: Good afternoon Christine,  Thanks for your questions. How many hours of sun do you think it gets each day under the oak tree? University of Maryland notes that it can tolerate full sun (6+ hours per day) to partial shade (4-6 hrs per day) so if it's getting less than that, you might possibly be right that it might need to be relocated.  My other thought is that it could be a watering issue. How much/how often have you been watering? It's possible that it may just need extra water this time of year given that it was just planted this spring (so the root system isn't very robust just yet) and that it has been quite hot and dry this month, so that could be a core issue as well.  In the meantime, I do think your instinct not to move it at the current moment in time is good, given the intense heatwave we're experiencing right now. I would recommend erring on the side of ample water for the next couple of weeks and re-evaluating whether it may be a sun issue, a water issue, or something else.  https://extension.umd.edu/resource/red-chokeberry/ Best wishes,  Rebecca\nUser: Hi, Morgan, I think you are exactly right. I have not been watering it enough and I am hoping that will make a difference. I watched more carefully and it is probably getting 4 hours of sun every day. It was doing well before we had such a reduction in rain and even has little berries. I have started watering it every morning.  I hope I haven't let it go too far - I don't think so! I have a black chokecherry I planted last spring that is doing well.  I watered it a lot.  Thank you so much. This is the second time I have contacted the extension and you all are fabulous!

Since the plant is getting about 4 hours of sun, it should be within the tolerable range for red chokeberry, though more sun could be beneficial. Keep monitoring the plant's condition, and continue with the morning watering routine. If possible, consider adding a layer of mulch around the base of the plant to help retain moisture and regulate soil temperature. This can be particularly helpful during hot weather. Keep an eye on the plant's response over the next few weeks, and feel free to reach out if you notice any further issues.

The Dawn Redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides), related to the giant Sequoias, has been successfully grown in Michigan. It requires various soils, full sun, and a moist site, as it will not tolerate dry sites. The native range of this species is Eastern China, and it’s suitable for USDA zones 5b to 9a. Muskegon, Michigan, is in Zone 6b, according to the 2023 USDA Hardiness Zone Map. More information is at these links: Dawn Redwood - Gardening in Michigan (msu.edu)  The Dawn Redwood | Michigan State University (msu.edu)  Moreover, there’s a fascinating case of a giant Sequoia in Northern Michigan that’s not only surviving but thriving. This tree, located at the Lake Bluff Bird Sanctuary, was planted in 1949 and has grown significantly. The success of this particular Sequoia is attributed to its proximity to Lake Michigan, which provides natural insulation and moderating temperatures during the winter and summer.  If you’re considering planting a Sequoia in Michigan, you must ensure that the site meets the necessary conditions for soil, sunlight, and moisture. Additionally, protection from harsh winter conditions would be crucial for the tree’s survival and growth.  I hope this helps!\nUser: Thank you for your quick response and helpful info!!    I'm not sure if it's a Red Sequoia. I'll have to check.

        "value": "<image>\n<image>\n<image>\nUser: Hello, I’ve been having problems this summer with what appears to be some type of bacterial wilt. It started with my peppers, I lost about eight pepper plants. Then it went to my tomato plants. I’ve lost about four and several more are wilted now. I noticed yesterday my Hardy hibiscus has three extremely wilted stems. (Not anywhere near my Vegetable garden) I’ve also lost several summer squash plants. The stems of the summer squash appear firm, no sign of squash borer.  Please help, I don’t know what to do with this or how to control it. I’ve read that it can live in the soil, so I’m worried about planting again next year. There is no sign of bacterial, ooze or milky discoloration in the stems of the dying plants. There are no signs of bugs or other disease anywhere on any of them. I live on farmland, but I had multiple gardens last year without this issue. I’ve attached a couple photos of the tomatoes and one of the hibiscus.\nExpert: The Hibiscus stem wilt is probably unrelated, and might be due to a different infection (Southern Blight perhaps, though usually damage from that infection is more extensive) or to stem-boring insects using this native(ish) plant as a host plant. Prune wilted stems off for now, and you can look inside the cut stem end (slice it in half lengthwise) to look for indications of either borer larvae or staining from infection. If neither appears present, the issue might have arisen in the crown instead (the place where stems emerge from the roots).  The tomato wilt, if caused by infection and not soil moisture stress, is more likely to be fungal in nature than bacterial. Fusarium Wilt is the most prevalent wilt disease in garden tomatoes in Maryland. You can use the information in the linked page, plus our Key to Common Problems of Tomatoes page, to determine if this is a likely culprit. Southern Blight is another possibility (the same pathogen that can affect ornamental plants), though there are ways it can be distinguished from Fusarium if the fungus is producing spore structures.  As close relatives of tomatoes, the peppers may have contracted the same disease, whichever blight or wilt pathogen may have been responsible.  Squash, as cucumber relatives, would be more likely to have contracted bacterial wilt from Cucumber Beetle feeding, which is a primary vector for that disease.  If you are not already doing so, growing cultivars with noted disease resistance to bacterial wilt or Fusarium (as applicable) can help avoid future outbreaks, though you may need to try a bit of crop rotation to avoid infection next year if there is contaminated soil. (Usually, at home garden scales, crop rotation as a preventative tactic isn't as effective as it can be at farm scales, but it's certainly worth trying. Or, you can try growing vulnerable plants in containers, though that of course might limit plant or harvest size, or make keeping up with watering and nutrient needs more challenging.)

We are concerned about the health of our trees, too, in particular that has a lot of shade for our yard. We are concerned that if we call a tree service, they will just tell us that they need to be cut down. We are wondering if there is a way to check the health of the tree and determine if there is a way to make it healthier as opposed to cutting it down. Thank you for any advice you can offer. I have attached photos in the hopes that this will help\nExpert: We recommend having any tree(s) of concern assessed by a certified arborist. Some are employed by tree-care companies, yes, but others consult independently and may be less biased towards recommending a course of action that would be costly. Arborists are trained in the science of tree care and risk assessment (for hazard trees, though not all arborists might have this latter expertise) and must keep up their training each year to retain their certification. Even so, it's possible two different arborists will come up with somewhat different diagnoses for a tree based on their individual experiences and approaches to evaluating the situation. They can't always intervene to rescue a tree from decline but can at least help identify possible causes of damage and sources of tree stress, some of which might be able to be alleviated to improve the tree's lifespan. Suburban stresses we can't always control do affect long-term tree health, though, and it's not uncommon for many trees to live much shorter lives in our landscapes compared with their counterparts in more undisturbed habitat.  The trunk in the photo might have a small amount of Smooth Patch, a fungal condition that is not a threat to tree health and which can be ignored. It's quite common on wild trees. In the bark close-up image we see lichen (also harmless and very common on bark) but no other issues. (We can't identify the tree species from bark alone.) The majority of tree pests and diseases attack trees under stress from conditions like drought, over-saturated soils in their root zone, or root injury (such as from construction or digging). Frustratingly, trees can be experiencing chronic or acute stress and not manifest symptoms we recognize right away; sometimes decline won't show up for months or even years later. This makes tracing-back the problem to a particular event or type of damage difficult, and no treatment can reverse any existing damage at that point from an insect or fungal/bacterial infection. Trees do have ways to try to halt the spread of wood decay within their trunks and branches, but this is not a process we can directly impact and time will tell if they successfully compartmentalize any existing decay.  Trees can decline or die for a wide variety of reasons, many of which are environmental and not pest- or pathogen-caused. Plus, often more than one stress factor that was involved either follows or overlaps with another, so a single event typically is not responsible for decline unless it was a catastrophic event, like a direct lightning strike.  From what we can see in the photos, the tree appears to be in decent shape, but an arborist may need to wait until foliage has emerged fully to better assess its canopy health.  Miri\nUser: Thank you so much for your quick and comprehensive response. I really needed that where to start in this house immensely. I’m also grateful for the link to the arborists.With appreciation, JenniferOn Thu, Mar 30, 2023 at 1:55 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

In 2015 the yard was relandscaped to remove large tree stumps and in the digging up of the yard, the landscaper mentioned that he'd never seen so many grubs.  Since that time I've annually applied Scotts brand Grub Killer in May/June.  I have not personally seen grubs, but haven't dug in the yard to look.  In 2021, the yard was redone again with new sod.  (The first sod was laid on black dirt that had dried to hard pan and it was never healthy.)  The 2021 sod has done well and looked good until this year in July.  Grub treatment was done twice in 2024; Scotts Grub Killer in 5-July and 7-August applied a 24-hr Grub Killer.   2).  In 2023 and/or in previous years, did you do any grub treatment? Yes Annually usually late may or early June   3).  For this season (2024), in  what month and exactly when in that month did you do the grub treatment?  See above.   4).  I assume that last spring (2024) and up to just recently, your turf looked fine.  That is, these brown patches of grass have only turned up since mid-July. Yes, That is correct   5).  In 2023 and/or in previous years, have these brown patches of turf appeared in these same areas?   Most specifically, were these brown patches present in these areas in late summer 2023? No, while there is always some die back of the grass, it has never looked like this.   6).  In the picture you sent, it appears that these brown patches of turf are in your left boulevard and the left part of your front yard.   About how many hours per day of DIRECT SUNLIGHT do these areas receive? The areas of the yard that have browned are in full sun.  The boulevard is another issue and not part of my question.  That area is cared for by the neighbor and is not watered regularly.   7).  Besides the areas shown in your picture, do you see this condition in other parts of your yard? We only have a small front yard and the boulevard to the east of the tree.   8).  Do you have any idea as to the type of grass you have?  Bluegrass?  Fescue?  Rye? Don't know what type of sod was used.  I can call the landscaper and see what they typically use, but it will be a guess.   9).  Please describe to me the general care given to your turf.  When was it last aerated?  In 2024, when did you apply any fertilizer?  In 2024, when did you apply any herbicide for weed control?  Have you ever done a soil analysis?   12-Apr-24  Scotts Fertilizer and Crabgrass preventor  Boulevard  4.5  Scotts      12-Apr-24  Menards fert + crabgrass prevention Lawn  4.5  Menards      5-Jul-24  Scotts Grub Killer  3.5  Scotts      7-Jun-24   Summer Fert  4.5  Gerten  24-0-4     11-Jul-24   Summer Fert  4.5  Gerten  24-0-4     7-Aug-24  24 Hr Grub Killer  4.25  Home Depot        No aeration has been done since the new 2021 sod.  No herbicide was used this year.  I hand pulled the few weeds. No soil analysis has been done     10).  What is your turf watering procedure and schedule? We have a sprinkler system, and it was set water twice a week during the 3-weeks we were on vacation in July.  The spring/early summer rains meant that the sprinkler system didn't run much.   I greatly apologize for my numerous requests.  However, there are literally dozens of things that may be causing the current condition in your turf.  Just looking at a picture does not provide me sufficient information to diagnosis the situation and provide you appropriate remedial steps. I appreciate your patience and understanding in these regards.

The consistent application of grub treatment suggests that grubs might not be the primary issue, especially since you haven't observed them directly. The full sun exposure and the watering schedule during your vacation might have contributed to the stress on the grass, especially if the weather was particularly hot or dry during that period. Additionally, the lack of aeration since 2021 could be affecting the soil's ability to absorb water and nutrients effectively. I recommend the following steps: 1) Consider aerating your lawn this fall to improve soil health and water absorption. 2) Ensure your sprinkler system is adjusted to provide adequate water, especially during hot and dry periods. 3) Conduct a soil analysis to check for nutrient deficiencies or pH imbalances. 4) If possible, identify the type of grass to tailor care practices more effectively. These steps should help improve the health of your lawn and prevent similar issues in the future.\"}"

Can you tell me what's wrong and what we should do?\nExpert: Good Evening Cheri,  Thank you for contacting the U of M Extension Service.  From viewing your photos, I can see the dead branch. Could it have been damaged by the wind? Is the branch broken?  Have you inspected the dead leaves, live leaves and the branches for signs of disease or insects?  Please click on the following link about redbud trees: ww.missouribotanicalgarden.org/PlantFinder/PlantFinderDetails.aspx?taxonid=280440&isprofile=1&basic=Cercis%20canadensis This information states:  Problems Canker can be a significant disease problem. Verticillium wilt, dieback, leaf spots, mildew and blights may also occur. Insect pests include Japanese beetles, tree hoppers, leaf hoppers, caterpillars, borers, webworms and scale. Keeping the tree vigorous by regular watering, fertilization and pruning out dead branches as needed will help keep the tree healthy. Deer tend to avoid this plant. From viewing your photo, the tree appears to be surrounded by rock and could be near a driveway. Have the roots been disturbed or chopped for any reason?  To help the tree thrive, I would suggest removing the landscape rock below the tree. Replace it with wood chip mulch a few inches away from the trunk out to the drip line of the branches. The wood chip mulch will protect the roots, hold moisture and keep the roots cool.  The landscape rock appears to heat up with the hot sun, reflecting the heat and heating up the surrounding soil and also the roots. I am assuming you watered it during the past two or three drought years.  Here is another link about pruning trees in late winter: https://extension.umn.edu/planting-and-growing-guides/pruning-trees-and-shrubs Good Luck!\nUser: Hi, Reese,  Thank you. The tree is next to our driveway but the base is surrounded by mulch, not rock (though there is rock on the other side of the walkway). The roots have not been disturbed. It's highly possible that it is just stressed from our weird weather. It's not just one branch that is affected...the base of the tree has three main parts to the trunk...it is all of the branches off one of the three parts. It has not been damaged by wind and the leaves just seem to be dried up (I don't see any signs of fungus or insects).   We'll just keep our fingers crossed that it comes back in the spring.   Thank you again for the information.    On Tue, Aug 6, 2024 at 8:25 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

Since you've ruled out physical damage and visible signs of pests or disease, it's possible that the issue could be related to root stress or a systemic issue affecting that particular section of the tree. Here are a few steps you can take to help the tree recover: \\n\\n1. **Watering**: Ensure the tree is receiving adequate water, especially during dry spells. Deep watering can help the roots absorb moisture more effectively.\\n\\n2. **Mulching**: Since the base is already mulched, ensure the mulch is not piled against the trunk, as this can cause rot. Maintain a mulch layer of about 2-3 inches to help retain soil moisture and regulate temperature.\\n\\n3. **Pruning**: Consider pruning the affected branches to prevent any potential spread of disease and to encourage new growth. Late winter is typically the best time for pruning.\\n\\n4. **Monitoring**: Keep an eye on the tree for any changes or new symptoms. If the condition worsens or you notice new signs of disease or pests, it might be beneficial to consult with a local arborist for a more detailed inspection.\\n\\nHopefully, with these measures, the tree will recover and show signs of improvement in the coming growing season.\"}"

I am glad to hear that you are on the lookout for cherry X disease. It is a severe threat to cherry production in the Pacific Northwest. You can get your tree tested by any of the labs listed here. However, the OSU Plant Clinic may be the closest option. You can find more information on submitting plant samples to OSU at this website: https://bpp.oregonstate.edu/plant-clinic/submit-sample/services-and-fees.  It is best to sample at least four (4) five-inch cuttings from symptomatic/diseased limbs including leaves, fruit, and fruit stems. The best time to sample is just before harvest through mid-August, though you can probably sample now if you are already seeing some symptomatic cherries (i.e., lagging in size or coloration). You may consider reading more about cherry X disease scouting and sampling at this website: https://treefruit.wsu.edu/crop-protection/disease-management/western-x/sampling-guide/. Please do not hesitate to reach out to Ask Extension with any additional questions. Thank you!

I have had this problem here with a number of varieties.\nExpert: Hi, Dakota, Are you referring to the end that attaches to the tomato or to the stem of the plant? Sounds like your tomatoes may be heavy and that would cause the split. You can use netting to tie the tomato to the trellis.  Sort of a hammock for the fruit. If you think this is a disease, please send pictures.   Otherwise, a good, strong trellis would work and tie the tomato stems to it with lightweight string or plastic tape every 6-8 inches to give it support. I am attaching a PDF with info on growing tomatoes. https://extension.oregonstate.edu/sites/default/files/documents/12281/growingtomatoes0.pdf Here is another link with pictures of split tomato vines.  Is this what you are referring to? https://therustedgarden.blogspot.com/2011/06/how-to-repair-damaged-tomato-stems.html If I am not correct defining the problem, please contact me again with more information.  Thank you.\nUser: Thank you for your response.  The splitting is on the end attached to the stem.  I grow the plants upright by tying them to a pole.  I have grown them in this manner, with good success in Seattle, near Walla Walla, WA, and near Nashville, TN.  I have been raising them here, in the same way for 16 or 17 years, and consistently have had a problem with cracks radiating from near the stem.  This year, and last, I have been raising BigBeefs. Farther back there have been several varieties, including at least one that was supposed to be crack resistant, but still getting cracks.  I am attaching  photos of the situation.  1.  Showing a portion of the vine as attached to the pole.  2. and 3.  Showing the cracks in the tomatoes still on the vine.  4.  Cracks in a tomato that has been harvested.

Uneven watering, where the soil alternates between being too dry and too wet, can lead to this problem. Since you're unable to use a raised bed, consider improving the soil drainage by incorporating organic matter like compost into the soil, which can help retain moisture more evenly. Additionally, applying a layer of mulch around the base of the plants can help maintain consistent soil moisture levels. If watering the lawn affects the tomatoes, try to water early in the morning to allow excess moisture to evaporate during the day. Consistent watering practices can help reduce the incidence of cracking. Enjoy your tomatoes, and feel free to reach out if you have more questions!\"}"

Based on the details you've provided and the images, it seems like your maple tree might be suffering from a common issue such as leaf scorch or a pest infestation like aphids or scale insects.

Here are a few steps you can take to help your tree recover:\\n\\n1. **Watering:** Ensure the tree is receiving adequate water, especially during dry spells. Deep watering once a week is more beneficial than frequent shallow watering.\\n\\n2. **Mulching:** Apply a layer of mulch around the base of the tree to help retain moisture and regulate soil temperature.\\n\\n3. **Inspect for Pests:** Check the undersides of the leaves and the bark for any signs of pests. If you find any, you might consider using insecticidal soap or neem oil as a treatment.\\n\\n4. **Leaf Samples:** Bringing in leaf samples to your local extension office, as you mentioned, is a great idea. They can provide a more precise diagnosis.\\n\\nIf the condition persists or worsens, consulting with a local arborist might be beneficial.

Have you added soil in the past? A better option would be to just use wood mulch chips in a layer that is 4-5\" thick. Mulch still allows for oxygen infiltration and water movement to the soil and tree roots.   Using soil can create a soil texture interface, where water and air may not move through easily.\nUser: Last fall I did add about 6\" of soil from the drip line toward the tree trunk because it was the lowest point in my surrounding landscape. How far out from the trunk of the tree should I remove the soil, at the trunk area should I expose the top of the roots? Then should I put mulch away from the trunk to the drip line?

You should carefully remove the added soil from around the trunk out to the drip line, ensuring that the root flare is visible. When applying mulch, start a few inches away from the trunk to prevent moisture buildup against the bark, which can cause rot. Spread the mulch out to the drip line in a layer about 4-5 inches thick. Shredded redwood or cedar mulch is a good choice as it decomposes slowly and helps retain moisture while allowing air and water to penetrate.

I went on vacation a week ago with no sign of this weed and came back today to find it growing everywhere I planted new grass. I'm trying to determine how best to remove it. I'm wondering if 4-Speed XT would be effective on it (but I'm a little worried about spraying a herbicide so close to the ~2 year old Emerald Green Arborvitae).\n\nThanks!\nEddie\nExpert: Hi, Morgan,  These are seedling maple trees (possibly Red Maple, Acer rubrum), and they just germinated, which is why you didn't see them before. All they need is one or two mowings as you normally care for the lawn -- nothing special -- and they will die out on their own because they can't tolerate losing that much growth being that young. Herbicide would be overkill in this situation and we're not recommending its use because it's not necessary.  Miri\nUser: Hi, Charlie!!  O wow, didn't expect it to be a tree! I believe my neighbor's tree is actually a red maple so that makes sense. Just kinda surprised how well the tree spread it's seed haha  Because the red maple is growing mostly in my new grass (less than 1 month old), would it be better to use a herbicide or just wait to mow it as you suggest?

However, since these are very young seedlings, they are unlikely to significantly impact your new grass if managed promptly. Mowing as soon as your new grass is ready for its first cut should be sufficient to control the seedlings. This approach avoids the use of herbicides, which could potentially harm your young grass. Keep an eye on the growth, and if you notice any persistent seedlings after mowing, you can manually remove them.

Protect the trees by covering them with plastic or cardboard during application.\\n\\n2. **Physical Barriers**: Consider installing a deeper physical barrier around the bed to prevent the roots from spreading into the lawn. This could involve digging a trench and installing a root barrier material.\\n\\n3. **Regular Monitoring and Removal**: Regularly check for new growth and remove it promptly. Hand pulling can be effective if done consistently, but ensure you remove the entire root system.\\n\\n4. **Soil Solarization**: If feasible, you might try soil solarization during the hottest months.

Have had other gardeners recently (including those on GrowWithKare11 facebook page), identify a plant we noticed last year on our hillside/yard, that is taking over the beautiful field grass we've grown accustomed to the last 30+ yrs. and slowly showing up elsewhere in our yard.  Majority all say it's Garlic Mustard.  Have no idea where it came from, but have been told to cut down before it flowers, get out at root if possible, but it's a long standing weed unfortunately.  Understand too it's edible, but a hillside of it, not appreciated. Many suggest Round Up applications for years.  Any other thoughts/suggestions would be appreciated!\nExpert: Thank you for writing.   Getting rid of garlic mustard is difficult becuase seeds remain viable in the soil for 10 years. Pulling individual garlic mustard plants by hand is the simplest and most effective approach to managing small or isolated infestations. When pulling plants, it is important to remove the upper portion of the roots as well as the stem, since buds in the root crown can produce additional stems. All pulled plants should be removed from the site as seed ripening continues even after plants are pulled. Repeatedly hand pulling of garlic mustard is effective for control in small areas but has limitations because seeds remain viable in the soil for up to 10 years. Therefore, it is important to pull all garlic mustard plants in an area every year until the seed bank is exhausted and seedlings no longer appear. This will require multiple efforts each year as rosettes can continue to bolt and produce flowers over an extended period (april-june).  HTTPS://WWW.CANR.MSU.EDU/IPM/INVASIVE_SPECIES/GARLIC_MUSTARD/MANAGEMENT_OPTIONS#:~:TEXT=IN%20MEDIUM%20TO%20LARGE%20SIZED,TO%20LIMIT%20GARLIC%20MUSTARD'S%20SPREAD.  You can solarize with clear plastic tarp, 2 mil thick.  put stones or logs to hold it down and let it sit for six weeks. After that, remove the tarp and top with 4 inches of wood mulch. https://extension.umn.edu/planting-and-growing-guides/solarization-occultation\nUser: Here's a few questions please on same matter I have cut and pasted. In addition can plastic be black or is clear preferred? Anxiously await a reply! Regards, Skyler, dellwood, mn<personal data hidden>\nExpert: Thank you for writing back. A burn will kill surface plants but will not kill seeds that are deep in the soil and viable for 10 years. Round Up only kills plants that are actively growing.  Again, it does not kill seeds.  Immediately put pulled weeds in a bag and send to a dump--the seeds continue to ripen after the plant has been pulled.  As the resource on solarization that I sent you states, clear plastic is significantly more effective than black.  Another reference for you. https://extension.psu.edu/garlic-mustard\nUser: Thank you for your input again, Steve! Will stick with clear tarp 2 ml at least after pulling. Don't wish to use hazardous chemicals and wondering if putting vinegar down before tarp would also help.  Thank you in advance!

Should we cut back to the green growth to encourage it to continue to grow or leave alone? Also, last year there was some dying needles near the top as well. I circled the dead portion in “Red” on the photo. Thank you\nExpert: Hello, there  I would give it a little more time before cutting it back.  It looks like the tree lost the leader branch a while back, and now there are 5 branches all coming out of the same place, which weakens the tree.  You want one strong, upright leader. That branch with the dead tip looks like it was becoming the leader- if the branch stays dead (no new growth appears) , you might want to prune off the entire branch down to the area that all the branches come from, and then pick the next most upright branch to become the new leader.\nUser: The small area circled in “Red” is a very small dead piece and right below it is some growth. If I just cut the small dead tip would the tree continue to grow from that leader or per your suggestion is to it back all the way down to the five branches and select a new leader? Thanks\nExpert: You can cut the dead tip off- and if there doesn't appear to be a \"candle\" of new growth under it (compare to the others for what it should look like), then maybe cut back the branch and let a new leader take over. There is not a big rush on this - you can wait until it is pretty obvious.\nUser: Attached is more of a close up on the tip that we’re discussing. It appears there are some candles, but very brown and dead looking. If I cut the branch off, I would need some of it still intact so I can tie the new leader to as a support, correct?"

I have livestock that grazes this area.\nExpert: Hi, Drew,  If you have a woody, shrubby sagebrush like big sagebrush (https://extension.usu.edu/rangeplants/shrubs-and-trees/big-sagebrush) you can mow them down with a rotary mower/cutter or a brush or flail shredder. You might need to mow again in a few years but that will provide pretty good control.   Repeated spring grazing in the same area favors sagebrush and leads to the understory grasses dying out and dense sagebrush populations. If you are able to change the grazing patterns, that will help a lot with the long term management of the sagebrush (e.g. area that is grazed in spring year 1 should be grazed in the summer year 2 and in the fall/winter year 3).    If you have a smaller, less woody sagebrush like fringed sagebrush (Artemisia frigida), mowing will not provide much control. Using a grazing plan that changes up the timing of grazing year to year will help grasses compete but other than that, I am not aware of non chemical control methods for this kind of sagebrush. Your local conservation district or NRCS office can help create a detailed grazing plan.   Teller-Park Conservation District: https://www.tellerparkcd.org/range-management  I'm not sure which NRCS office would be the closest to you, there are offices in Fremont County (Canon City), Chaffee County (Salida) and Grand County (Kremmling). You can lookup their phone numbers and addresses here:  https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/contact/find-a-service-center?state=08&county=  Thank you for using AskExtension! - Denyse\nUser: Thank you, Harper. I have the (Artemisia frigida). My neighbor used Epsom Salts and vinegar and it killed the sage. I would spot spray. Think I can do this and not ruin my soil for grass to grow? I have Brome and my horse grazes the field. It is not overgrazed.    Or, could I just add something to the soil in that area that it might help the grass to grow better there and repel the sage?  On Aug 14, 2024, at 2:51 PM, Ask Extension wrote:\nExpert: Hi, Drew,  I don't recommend adding salts however you could spot spray the sagebrush with concentrated vinegar (should be at least 30%). It will kill the top growth. The plant will regrow from its root reserves so it will have to be spot sprayed with the vinegar until it has used up all its root reserves but it will eventually kill the plant. You could interseed a legume, like alfalfa or red clover, to add some nitrogen to the soil which will benefit the grasses. If you have a manure pile you could also spread some of the manure in that area. I would use a pile that has been sitting for at least a year. I would not do that if the horses have been eating in a weedy area or eaten weedy hay though. That won't repel the sagebrush but it could help the grasses be more competitive. It would be good to get a soil test from that area before spreading any manure or adding any soil amendments to check nutrient and salt levels (can also identify if there are other issues with the soil). I recommend choosing a test that at least covers pH, salts, organic matter, nitrate-nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Below are links to a few labs that do soil testing: https://www.wardlab.com/submit-a-sample/soil-health-analysis/ https://weldlabs.com/ag-soil/ https://agsci.colostate.edu/soiltestinglab/price-list/  Changing up the grazing pattern will still help encourage the grasses and deter the sagebrush. It has to do more with how the grasses versus sagebrush grow than overgrazing so if that's a possibility, I do recommend trying that.   Thank you for using AskExtension! - Denyse\nUser: Thank you.

Improving soil drainage and fertility can make the environment less hospitable. Consider adding lime to raise the pH and organic matter to improve soil structure.\\n\\n3. **Mulching**: Apply a thick layer of mulch to suppress the growth of horsetail. This can help reduce light penetration and slow down their growth.\\n\\n4. **Chemical Control**: If you choose to use herbicides, look for those specifically labeled for horsetail. Be cautious with application to avoid harming your desired plants. Herbicides containing glyphosate can be effective, but multiple applications may be necessary.\\n\\n5. **Barrier Methods**: Installing a physical barrier around the area can help prevent the spread of horsetail from adjacent areas.\\n\\n6. **Regular Monitoring**: Keep an eye on the area and remove any new growth promptly to prevent the horsetail from re-establishing.\\n\\nCombining these methods can increase your chances of success.

        "value": "User: Hello. I've recently discovered a grub infestation in my raised beds. Yesterday, I dug out over 50 grubs in and around existing plants in one hour in one 4x4 bed. I started noticing that some of my plants (lettuces, spinach, beets) were wilting and dying with seemingly no root growth 3 weeks ago. Over the course of this time I watered more, added fertilizer, and planted new seedlings. When I began to suspect a pest, I placed collars around plants thinking I might have a cutworm issue.  But, it's clear now that pests are grubs.\n\nMy question is- what should I do now that I know of the problem?  The problem is in all 3 of my 4x4 raised beds- although one bed appears to be more grossly affected than the other 2. All three beds are full of plants at the moment- greens, garlic, onions, carrots, radishes, beets and some herbs. I'm about to add tomatoes and cucumbers and some other warm season plants I've grown from seed.\nI try to grow as organically as possible so I don't want to use a pesticide. I think my options are 1) spray with BT 2)just keep digging them out  3) replace the soil or 4) remove the plants, let nature run its course and replant the bed later in the year\n\nDo you have any other ideas? What would you recommend for going forward to mitigate the further loss of plants?  And what would you recommend in the future to prevent such an infestation?\n\nThe beds have been in place for 2 years. I covered them with a mulch of leaves and compost in the fall. I removed that layer in April and amended with 3 bags of compost (a combination of Moo Compost and another brand that I can't remember). I did most of my planting in early April and have been adding plants here and there since then.  \n\nThanks, ElliotAnn\nExpert: Hi, ElliotAnn, Thanks for reaching out to the UVM Extension Master Gardener Helpline.

But, all have the characteristic forelegs, orange head, and white body with black stripe down the middle.On Fri, May 26, 2023, 4:01 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: Hi, ElliotAnn,  That is a frustrating discovery, and thank you for the excellent photos.  It will still be difficult to pinpoint if this is one species or not, but we can safely say these are grubs of the scarab beetle family.  Check out this excellent article from U of West Virginia on these grubs and additional info from U of Minnesota.  Of note in these articles is that you will want to dig up another plant and observe the roots -- if you see healthy feeder roots (the fine roots) the grubs may not be the culprit.   You mention you saw these symptoms at the beginning of May, just past a period of weeks of rain.  Is there a chance the initial symptoms were from too much moisture or did you observe the grubs eating the roots?  Were all the plants transplants or some direct sown?  Had you hardened off any transplants prior to planting to make sure they could withstand cold night temps?  How was root development at planting?  This list of questions will help you to determine if there were other stresses on the plants prior to going into the garden, including water moisture levels (too dry or too saturated), soil and air temperatures, and general vigor of your plantings.  Assuming the grubs are eating your veg starts, BT would only work if applied directly onto exposed grubs, and if you are digging them up, I wouldn't bother with a pesticide, too.  You will want to go down the route of soil drenches of either milky spore or a beneficial nematode, as well as encouraging natural predators of adults and perhaps hand-picking adult known pest beetles, such as Japanese and Asiatic beetles, rose chafers, and others (see the above UWV page for a short list).  See below for some info and ideas on the above.  For nearly a century, various university-led projects around the  country have introduced the parasitic wasps, Tiphia v. and Tiphia popilliavora Rohwer and a parasitic tachinid fly, Istocheta aldrichi, to some success in the control of the Japanese beetle. In many areas these introduced pests have continued to acclimate to the various climates of our continent and have spread beyond their  original localities.  The Tiphia vernalis, as the name implies, is active in the Spring, peaking late May to mid-June. Prior to laying eggs on host grubs, it will feed off of honeydew secreted by various sucking pests, such as aphids. You can often spot them collecting honeydew from young maple and cherry species as well as peonies probably from the ants opening up the blooms). To help increase the success of a release, spray sugar water on foliage to provide additional nutrition to them prior to mating and ovipositing eggs onto host grubs.  Tiphia popilliavora Rohwer and Istocheta are active later in the mid-Summer, attacking younger larvae and adults, respectively, They also feed on nectar of Umbel family plants, such as wild carrot (Queen Anne's lace). You could supplement your natural  wildflower zones with a patch of umbel plants such as dill, cilantro, fennel, replanted carrots, etc. allowing all to bloom for Summer. I would add additional small-flowered blooms, such as brassicas gone to flower (spring-planted bok choi / mustards, overwintered kale, etc.), sweet allysum, chamomile, daisies, and yarrows, all perfectly sized for small mouth-parts of the beneficial tachinid flies and tiphiid wasps, which both lay eggs on host insects and larvae feed on the hosts. Check out this photo of a tachinid-egg-covered JB-- you would want to move this specimen off your plants, but keep it alive to increase the population of beneficial insects in your landscape. The wasps work do their magic on the grubs beneath the soil.  Some research has shown an additional beneficial nematode, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (Hb) that would attack the larval grub stage of the beetle. This is probably more easily sourced than the Tiphia or Istocheta, which I haven't found available commercially. My husband is a produce farmer here in Hyde Park, and we have ordered nematodes from Arbico Organics in the past. I believe there are many other northeast-based companies for biological controls, some listed on UVM's page below.  For additional resources on Integrated Pest Management and  controlling and identifying Japanese beetle damage, check out the following pages: page from U of MinnesotaUVM's IPM page - see a list at the very bottom for companies selling biological controls\"Host Selection of Spring Tiphia (Tiphia vernalis) and Summer Tiphia (Tiphia popilliavora), Natural Enemies of Japanese and Oriental Beetles\" by Piyumi Tilanka Obeysekara, PhD (lengthy thesis, but full of some interesting research on these insects from U of Connecticut)The U of Minnesota page also suggests other insecticides for use in lawns, as well as best practices in application (very important for our at-risk bee and pollinator populations). Be sure to follow manufacturers' instructions when applying any insecticides, both conventional and organic. If you decide you have a very bad case of beetles (note past year's experiences, as well as lawn  damage, a sign of the grubs), and want to pursue a conventional  insecticide, be aware that you may also be killing other insects, such as the beneficials listed above, and other micro- and macro- organisms that are helping to support healthy ecosystem functions in your landscape.  There are also warnings for use in areas used for edible crops, so I encourage you to read all labels thoroughly or call the manufacturer for this info.  Grub-X for example has a half-life of 12 months from last application for use with edible crops.  If you decimate some of your pest and many of its natural predators, you may throw the balance to continuing to have a problem, rather than finding the equilibrium you seek (aka, a bountiful harvest!). Often, a multi-tiered approach is going to garner more consistent resulsts, as each layer of protection (cultural (aka, growing) practices, exclusion, and beneficials) will increase likelihood of success.   Check out this excellent article on the Soil Food Web from U of Florida to better understand the many organisms that are active in the soil and interacting with our plants to cultivate healthy  landscapes.  Final words of advise as you wrap your brain around all this info: Do not use beetle traps, as they often attract the beetles to your yard, rather than away from your crops. These are only effective with very large commercial plantings. Also, make sure you are tending to your plants and keeping them healthy, as robust plants are both less attractive to pests, as well as better  able to weather a short infestation with little consequence to  productivity.

Choisya isn't known for having a lot of problems, it is possible some of the spotting is just due to environmental damage after a cold winter. It is also possible that there are mites or another sucking pest on the undersides of the leaves causing some of the spotting. If you flip the leaves over, do you see any pests?   Here is more information about this plant: https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/choisya-ternata/  Also, if you are still concerned or think there may be pests on the plant, feel free to bring an affected branch sample or two to the Yamhill County Extension office and we can look at it. https://extension.oregonstate.edu/yamhill  Thank you for using Ask Extension!\nUser: No pests that I’ve seen.

Multiple species in this group occur in Maryland, and the type of plant they are eating helps with identification, as body color and pattern on caterpillars can vary with caterpillar age or genetics. Some are generalists, eating a variety of host plants, while others specialize in certain plant types. Is this individual on a Strawberry or Potentilla plant? We can't quite identify the foliage, unless it happened to fall off an overhanging tree and is wandering around on plant it's not eating (especially since most hornworm species feed on trees, shrubs, or vines).  Since several hornworm caterpillars look alike and can be hard to identify, but since this one is a bit more distinctive, our best guess is that this is a Nessus Sphinx. Their host plants are grape relatives -- wild and cultivated Grapes, Virginia Creeper, and the invasive species Porcelainberry. A gallery of the adults and a few caterpillars can be found on the linked page.

Given the conditions you've described, there are a few potential reasons why your Austrian Copper Rose might not be blooming. First, while your pot size seems adequate, roses can sometimes become root-bound in containers, which can affect blooming. Consider checking the roots to see if they are tightly packed and, if so, repotting into a slightly larger container or refreshing the soil might help. \\n\\nSecond, while you are providing fertilizer, it's important to ensure that the nutrient balance is appropriate for blooming. Roses typically benefit from a balanced fertilizer with a higher phosphorus content to encourage blooms. You might want to try a fertilizer specifically formulated for blooming roses.\\n\\nThird, the winter conditions, while protective, might be affecting the plant's natural cycle. Roses need a period of dormancy, and while your garage is cold, it might not be cold enough to trigger this dormancy fully. Additionally, the transition from garage to full sun should be gradual to prevent shock.\\n\\nLastly, consider the possibility of environmental stressors such as late spring storms, which can affect blooming. Protecting the plant from extreme weather changes can help.\\n\\nIf you decide to plant it outside, you can protect it through the winter by mulching heavily around the base and using a rose cone or burlap to shield it from extreme cold. This can help it survive the harsh winter conditions at your elevation.\"}"

From your photo, it appears there may have been a double (forked) trunk and that one side has been removed. Is that the case?   We do not recommend filling or painting holes in trees with any type of material. This practice will inhibit the tree from healing itself and can also can seal in pests, moisture, and rot making the tree worse.   Your tree has multiple signs of pests and deterioration. I recommend that you remove the entire tree because of it's size and safety concerns. You may want to consult with a certified arborist, and you can locate them on the Homeowner's tab on this website: https://pnwisa.org/page/choosing-a-qualified-arborist  I hope this information is helpful. Please write again any time your have horticultural questions.\nUser: Yes, the tree was \"pruned\" maybe 5 or more years ago. I can't remember what the tree man told my husband was wrong with it.I am going to take your advice and try to get an arborist to look at it. Thank you for your help. It is much appreciated.JudithOn Mon, Aug 26, 2024 at 1:07 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

These were 100-day fruits and we are well past that now, but none of the harvest signs seem to be present. I'm wondering if I'm missing something or if I just need to wait longer.\n\nBeyond that, how do you suggest curing them--at what temp and for how long?

For storage, keep them in a cool, dry place, ideally between 50-55 degrees Fahrenheit, with good air circulation. \\n\\nRegarding sharing with the food bank, waiting a couple of weeks after harvest is a good idea to ensure they are fully cured and will last longer for the recipients.\"}"

I want something that is low maintenance, low growing, takes little water, and is a pollinator.\n\nThank you, Avery\nExpert: Thank you for contacting \"Ask Extension\".  You asked about Snow-in-Summer (Cerastium tomentosum) as a ground cover in your partial sun area.  (I think you wanted to ask about a second plant and typed in Snow-in-summer twice), I don't recommend Snow-in-Summer for the area you described. While very beautiful, it requires full sun with well drained soil It is a short-lived plant that may result in dead patches in a covered area and  can develop root rot in over wet soil conditions. It would do well in a container, or in other areas of your garden with conditions more to its liking.  Here's some other suggesting I found. In her book Big Ideas for Northwest Small Gardens, Marty Wingate recommends Mazus reptans. It is semi-evergreen to evergreen with tiny blue flowers from late spring through summer. It takes full sun to part shade and is delicate looking, but takes foot traffic. It requires some fertilizer to stay perky.  This next article gives some specific native ground covers that you may want to consider. Of the plants mentioned, my favorites are F. virginiana (wild strawberry) and Oregon grape. The F. Virginian tolerates foot traffic, but gets a little too high to function as a walkway. https://extension.oregonstate.edu/news/native-groundcovers-are-great-home-landscapes  My personal go-to publication is Gardening with Oregon Native Plants West of the Cascades. It list plant names along with great pictures of the plants. Look under ground covers perennials. https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/ec1577 I hope you find this information useful.

Additionally, ensure that the wood chips are not piled too thickly, as this can create a conducive environment for pests.\\n\\nIf you decide to use a miticide, look for one that is specifically labeled for spider mites and is safe for use around wildlife.

Thanks,Barbara Postman <personal data hidden>   On Fri, Jul 26, 2024 at 7:43 AM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: Barbara I thought I'd go ahead and give you a couple of potential answers to what is going on with your crabapples to maybe get you an answer before the weekend. Wet weather could be contributing plants can drop leaves from overwatering so your thought on 'wet feet' is a reasonable one.  In looking at the location of your tree it doesn't seem like that area would be too wet.  Clay does drain less well than other soils, but crabapples can thrive here in the Champlain Valley where I live and the clay is deep! The wet weather, however, can contribute to diseases especially those caused by fungi.  A common one is 'Apple Scab' that can cause leaf blotching and subsequent dropping of infected leaves.  Here is how the condition is described: Leaf spots are round, olive-green, and up to 1/2\" across Spots are velvet-like with fringed borders As they age, spots turn dark brown and get bigger/grow together  Spots often form along the leaf veins Leaves with many spots turn yellow and drop by mid-summer  The condition can also impact the fruit - they show similar spots and if infected early can become deformed and cracked. Spores can be carried by the wind (and likely built up with our very wet summer last year) but you should rake up the leaves and fruit and remove from the area (burn or compost) to decrease the risk of infection next year.  On a mature tree the condition usually doesn't kill the tree and doing nothing is often recommended, but on your young tree there is reason for concern.  You might want to consider fertilizing the tree and if the weather gets dry, you want to be sure to provide adequate water (trees need extra watering for at least 2 years after planting). In the future you can look into scab-resistant cultivars of crabapples. I'm attaching a photo here for you to compare to your leaves.  If it doesn't look like this is the problem with your crabapple, please do send a photo or two and I'll look into what else might be causing this problem. By the way, it looks like this will be a lovely garden as all the plantings mature!\nExpert: Barbara, I've asked the program folks if you can drop the leaves off and waiting for a reply.  I also sent a photo of apple scab that you compare your leaves to. Best, Andrea\nExpert: Hello, Charlie:  We had the UVM Plant Pathologist take a look at your submission, and following is the info. she provided:  To me, the plant looks overall chlorotic which I suspect is an issue in the root system. It may be just trying to get established but there may also be root rot in there making things worse from all the wet weather.   Apple do not like wet feet. There is not much you can do this late in the season. If it was earlier I would recommend fertilizer, but it is getting too close to fall to give it much Nitrogen now. I think you have to just cross your fingers at this point and see how it comes out next spring. I would give it some 10-10-10 or ProGro 5-4-3 in May and hopefully it will recover.   I hope this information is helpful and wish you luck that the tree looks better next season.\nUser: Thanks very much for your information. I will take some samples of the soil around the tree and send them in. And also hope for the best.

Drilling holes around the tree and filling them with coarse materials like sand, gravel, or a mix of compost and sand can help improve drainage. This method, often referred to as vertical mulching, can help aerate the soil and allow excess water to drain more effectively. Be careful not to damage the roots while drilling. Additionally, you might consider creating a slight slope or using a French drain to redirect water away from the tree. These methods can help alleviate the waterlogging issue without the need to dig up the tree.\"}"

In your area, this typically means applying in the fall when the weeds are still green and growing, but before the first hard frost. Monitor the weather and the growth stage of the weeds closely. If the weeds are still actively growing, you can proceed with the application now. However, if the weeds have already gone dormant or if a hard frost is imminent, it may be less effective to apply the herbicide at this time.\"}"

Introducing beneficial nematodes, such as Steinernema feltiae, can be an effective biological control method. These nematodes parasitize and kill root aphids. Apply them to the soil when it is moist, as they require moisture to move through the soil. Additionally, maintaining healthy soil with good organic matter can help support beneficial organisms that naturally control pest populations. You might also consider crop rotation and avoiding planting the same susceptible crops in the same location each year. Finally, ensure that your plants are not stressed, as healthy plants are more resistant to pest infestations. Regular monitoring and early intervention are key to managing root aphids effectively.\"}"

What are they and how do I get rid of them?\nExpert: The insects you have are beetles, it is hard to say if you have carpet beetles, storage pest beetles or wood boring beetles. It would be helpful if you could examine your food storage area such as a pantry for any signs of an infestation in the food packages. The other type of beetle carpet beetles can damage items such a any products that have dried organic parts such as wool clothing, furs, dried flower arrangements, feathers as examples. The last kind are wood boring beetles, The damage they cause are to wooden furniture where they leave fine power where they bored into wooden furniture. I have attached a publication on these three types of beetles. If you can, read them and let me know if one matches the problem you have with these beetles. That you are finding them all year around means you need to try managing this pest ASAP. Let me know if you have any additional questions. Rich\nUser: Hi, Quinn, Thank you so much for sending this information—it is extremely helpful. Except that I don’t think any of these are the beetles I have. I’ve definitely ruled out the carpet beetles--my beetles don’t look anything like any of the three that are shown in Pub 7436. For one thing, my beetles do not have short antennae, their antennae are long. I’ve also ruled out the various kinds of pantry beetles. For one thing, my beetles are tiny compared to those shown as \"actual size.” For another, I have zero evidence of infestation in any of my food storage areas, and believe me, I checked very carefully! So that leaves the powderpost beetles. At first I thought they might be a possible candidate, especially because the upstairs room where my beetles are most pronounced, and in which they appeared first, is completely paneled in wood! However, close reading of PNW 326 leads me to the conclusion that they are not my beetle. My beetle is medium brown with an almost greenish tint; its body is definitely not \"dark brown to nearly black\" (lyctidae), or \"reddish-brown to nearly black” (anobiids and bostrichids). My beetle has antenna that are very skinny and very long, almost a third as long as its head/body; its antenna do not look like any of the pictured antenna. My beetle has gold-colored legs. I do not see any exit (emergence) holes in the wood, nor any powdery frass.I am wondering what to do next. I wouldn’t be concerned because I’ve always just vacuumed them up when they showed up every spring (this has been going on pretty much ever since I moved in 40 years ago). But now, I’m seeing them all year round (though not in the great numbers I see every spring). And, as I mentioned, they are now for the first time showing up in other parts of the house, including a few downstairs! Would it be possible to gather some and bring them down to show you? I really don’t want to “employ a professional…insecticide or fumigant” unless I have to. If that’s what you think I should do, do you have any suggestions for what kind I should buy? Many thanks for your help!Cathleen SmithOn Mar 24, 2023, at 4:23 PM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: Your note does not surprise me.

I understand from other publications that basically I should caulk crevices, cracks, and holes around the windows where I see the most beetles.  For me, this means just two windows. (I wasn’t entirely accurate when I complained I was seeing them everywhere in the house. I have them in great numbers in only two adjoining rooms). Do you have any idea what time of year this caulking should be done? The numbers of beetles are really dying down at this point, is this when I want to do it? Or later in the summer?I don’t have an elm tree in my yard, but I’m guessing there’s one in the neighborhood because my neighbor has the same problem (I’m not sure what elm trees look like, so that’s a problem). Anything you can tell me about the best timing for my sealing/caulking would be greatly appreciated.

In the fall we noticed some of the boxwoods looked like they were not doing well compared to others.  All are big plants, likely many years old.  There has been no improvement this spring.  I'm wondering what the problem is and what to do about it.\nExpert: Hi, Skyler older boxwoods you could do a regeneration prune to thin out and remove some of the old dying growth to help regenerate some new growth and vigor. If they are been sheared in the past (it does look like it from these photos), it only stimulates the end growth of the plant and causes them to develop thick outer growth , not allowing light and air movement to the inner branches which can cause die back and disease issues. The orange color is usually from winter damage and fluctuating winter temperatures. The branches with the straw color should be pruned out all together. You can explore our Identify common Boxwood problems webpage to see if you can explore other issues. There is also a link at the bottom of the page for a YouTube video on the pruning techniques to help thin them out and get rid of the damaged stems. If there are any specific disease issues, proper pruning tends to be the best solution for maintenance anyways, unless you see other telltale symptoms.  Feel free to continue to send photos or reach out with other questions.  Emily\nUser: Hi, Emerson’s almost a year later now.  The boxwood problem seems to me to be spreading to other boxwoods…I probably have between 18 and 24 Boxwoods total.  I’m wondering if there is someplace in the area where I could take or send more pictures of some of the yellowing or whitening vegetation.  If it is the boxwood blight apparently the only thing to do it dig out every one that is yellowing.  I’d hate to lose them all but don’t know what to do.  I live in South Laurel.   Thanks for your any help you can give me. John\nExpert: Hello, Jordan,  You are welcome to share photos here, in this discussion thread; while the system might limit you to three attachments per reply, you can reply more than once in order to send more pictures if needed. If you prefer, you might be able to bring samples in to your local county Extension office, but reach out to them ahead of time to see if they can do such a diagnosis. (Sometimes, county offices just send the inquiry to us at Ask Extension if they don't have a horticulture specialist or plant pathologist on-site, since we at HGIC are not based in a county office, but answer queries from around the state.)  One of the most common ailments we see on the myriad boxwood questions we're sent throughout the year is the fungal disease Volutella Blight. Like many plant infections, its severity and spread can be weather-dependent, more severe in wet conditions when rains are regular or when plants are irrigated often (or with sprinklers that wet the foliage). Volutella is a comparatively weak pathogen, meaning that it largely takes advantage of struggling plants that are stressed from some other cause (like winter damage or over-pruning), and it tends not to cause damage on healthy plants. Since this fungus does not kill the roots, a drastic cut-back like Emily had mentioned is often the best recourse, especially since pruning out dying branches would otherwise leave a patchwork of unappealing scraggly stems. A photo example of a pruned-back boxwood shrub that has begun to regrow is attached, if helpful. Granted, given the slow growth rate of boxwoods, it will take a few years to regain its former size, but if the shrub is not sheared in the meantime, it probably will be less vulnerable to future Volutella infections or other issues because the foliage won't be as crowded.  Boxwood Leafminer is the other problem we see very frequently, and high populations can cause a lot of foliage discoloration (turning orange-yellow), blistering, and premature leaf shedding. If this pest is present, the bright yellow-orange adult gnats will probably emerge fairly soon and hover over the plants. (They don't bite.) On a quiet day in spring, you might even be able to hear the shrub rustling (like the subtle popping of wet Rice Krispies) with the activity of the juveniles while they are still inside the leaves. Heavy pruning, as for Volutella management, will also help remove the majority of these insects from an infested shrub. Some boxwood cultivars are more inherently susceptible to this insect than others. Some insecticides work well for management of this pest, but we generally discourage their use since they might impact beneficial insects.  Boxwood Blight is less likely if the ailing plants have discolored foliage like you describe, since usually an advanced stage of infection results in no foliage (they shed pretty quickly, sometimes while still mostly green) and a very bare, twiggy appearance, especially in large sections of the plant, or starting around their base. If it is present, then yes, replacement with non-boxwood alternatives is the most practical solution.  Miri\nUser: Thank you, Charlie, for your help.  If you think it would be of any value, I’d be happy to take two or three pictures and post them.  John\nExpert: Yes, if you are unsure about a diagnosis based on the information and images included in the links sent previously, sharing photos will help us narrow-down what might be going on with your plants. Images of the overall shape (health/appearance) of the plants as well as clear close-ups of any distinct symptoms will help.

I have an Issai kiwiberry that is about six years old, and every year after blooming the fruit begins to swell, then develops brown spots and falls, and then about half the leaves turn brown, and there is a bit of dieback. New growth will continue in other areas. Do you know what this might be, and would I be safe taking that plant out and putting in new ones in the same season if I get to killin' while it's still dormant?\nExpert: Hi, Harper, Because it takes years to get hardy kiwi to bear fruit, you may want to try to manage this problem before removing and replacing the plant. Kiwis need pruning to improve air circulation and can suffer from root rot, so they don’t like very wet soils or heavy clay soil. Below is the most thorough kiwi publication I could find. “Issai” is identified as particularly susceptible to root rot. Discussion  of the importance of picking a good, non-soggy planting site is mentioned at the end. https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/sites/catalog/files/project/pdf/pnw507.pdf The U of M page below mentions “Issai” and has good info on growing thee plants here. Again, root rot is identified as the main problem with these plants. In the section on kiwi varieties, “Issai” is in the center column and is mentioned as needing regular pruning. Increasing air circulation around the plant will reduce problems if this is linked to too much moisture. https://extension.umn.edu/fruit/commercial-kiwiberry#diseases-1894161I’ve tossed a lot of information your way. Sorry I can’t be more definitive, but I’d think about your planting site (too wet?) and watering practices. Never use a sprinkler on the plant and if the plant needs water, use a hose at the base of the plant. And prune to improve air circulation. Good luck.\nUser: Thanks!On Mon, Mar 20, 2023, 7:54 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

For now, you should remove any visibly infected or dead wood, cutting back to healthy tissue. Make sure to dispose of the infected material away from your garden to prevent further spread. Additionally, improving air circulation and ensuring the plant is not in overly wet conditions can help reduce the risk of further infections.

In moderation they are OK as early food for pollinators emerging from winter dormancy.  When the lawn is taken over, not so good.  For this season, I suggest they you simply mow the tops off to prevent them from seeding this year. They can be pulled with a tool that does not require you to bend but you must get the tap root. Like most weeds, a dandelion is able to out compete grass when the conditions are better for the dandelion than the grass. Let your grass grow to 4 inches and cut it to 3 inches--this makes a thicker sod with deeper roots and disadvantages dandelions.  In the process of building a bee lawn you may be adding snow glories, forget me nots, bluebells, daffodils and other plants to your lawn--all of these will compete with dandelions.\nUser: Thank you so much for the info! On Tue, May 9, 2023, 5:33 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

We have a person coming to remove the stump next Thursday (4/20). To get the stump and as many of the large roots as possible, he is going to pretty much grind out that whole area down about 22 inches. I don't want to lose my plants! I don't think I would ever consider transplanting perennials this time of year, but am hoping that I can at least temporarily do so without killing them. If I can transplant them, is there anything I should do differently than I usually do given it is only mid-April? And, if transplanting them is a terrible idea, do you have any suggestions for how I might salvage them?

Here are some steps you can take to minimize stress on the plants: \\n\\n1. **Watering**: Ensure the plants are well-watered a day before you plan to transplant them. This helps reduce transplant shock.\\n\\n2. **Digging**: Carefully dig around each plant, trying to keep as much of the root ball intact as possible. For larger plants like the shrubs and ligularia, you may need to dig a wider area to preserve the roots.\\n\\n3. **Temporary Holding Area**: Prepare a temporary holding area with similar soil conditions. You can use pots or a shaded area in your garden. Make sure this area is ready before you start digging up the plants.\\n\\n4. **Replanting**: Replant the perennials and shrubs as soon as possible. If you need to store them temporarily, keep the roots moist and shaded.\\n\\n5. **Aftercare**: Once transplanted, water them thoroughly and keep an eye on them for signs of stress. Mulching can help retain moisture and regulate soil temperature.\\n\\nIf transplanting seems too risky, consider taking cuttings or dividing some of the perennials to propagate them elsewhere. This way, even if the original plants don't survive, you'll have new ones growing.\\n\\nGood luck with your project, and I hope your plants thrive in their new location!\"}"

It has been doing real well.except for last year ..it was a bit thinner than previous years .and hard seeds stayed with tree all year ,fall, winter and still now. They do drop and terribly messy. The previous year 2 seasons ago we had the tree professionally trimmed. I also have the tree deep root feeded twice yearly. My question is what can I expect this year, can it get back to normal ( no seeds retained all season)..or what do you recommend I do? I am going to try and send pic..you have been helpful in past questions..thank you\nExpert: Hi, Jordan, While it may not happen every year, ash trees are known to retain their seeds through the winter months. An article at the link below mentions seeds living all winter long: https://extension.umn.edu/forest-pests-and-diseases/managing-ash-woodlands#increase-the-number-of-non-ash-trees-1816113 (under the heading \"Increase the number of non-ash trees).   From research, it also appears that 2022 was a \"mast\" year for white ash. This means it was a year where most ash trees produced an unusually high number of seeds.  Article from Columbus, Ohio: https://holdenfg.org/news/ash-trees-are-exploding-with-seeds-researchers-are-capitalizing-on-it/  I would recommend continuing with the treatments you established. Does your yard have a sprinkler system? If it does be sure the sprinkler streams are not directly hitting the stem of the ash tree, as this can accelerate root fungal issues. If you do not have a sprinkler system, be sure to deep water the tree when no rain has fallen in 5 days (or in dry conditions). To properly water a tree, be sure a sprinkler is set up to thoroughly soak the area from the trunk to just beyond the edge of the canopy as this is where the fine roots occur.  Closely monitor the tree this year, and if things change for the worse, then I would seek a professional consultation.  A certified arborist is always best; arborists are certified through the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA). ISA maintains a website that makes it easy to find a certified arborist: https://www.treesaregood.org/findanarborist With hopes the tree does just fine this summer - and into the future! All the best, -Julie\nUser: Thank you, Elliot ..couple questions..I have sprinkler system and it covers what you describe well..Not sure what the stem of the tree is..branches?..also I read the article on the seeds..the picture of the seed is not like what I see on branches and on ground...what I have are little balls, maybe 3/4 in.in diameter..they are hard as rocks..are the seeds inside these ball shapes?..Sent from AT&T Yahoo Mail on Android  On Wed, Apr 19, 2023 at 8:53 AM, Ask Extension<<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

It seems like your tree is generally healthy, but the seed retention and the presence of hard balls could be due to gall formation, possibly caused by mites, as you mentioned. These galls are typically not harmful to the tree, but they can be unsightly and messy. Since your sprinkler system has been in place for 20 years without apparent issues, it may not be an immediate concern, but it's always good to monitor for any changes in the tree's health. If the sprinkler is consistently hitting the trunk, it could potentially lead to fungal issues over time, so adjusting the sprinkler to minimize direct contact with the trunk might be beneficial. Continuing with your current care routine and monitoring the tree's health is advisable. If you notice any significant changes or worsening conditions, consulting with a certified arborist would be a prudent step. They can provide a more detailed assessment and recommend specific treatments if necessary. Best wishes for a healthy tree this season!\"}"

What is your current grass and are you trying to replant with the same type of grass? Could your current grass be dormant? If it is diseased and therefore dead, then you will need to identify the underlying cause before adding new seed or grass.  There are a number of grasses what work reasonably well in Austin, but you do not want to start adding new grass - or grass seeds - to your current grass if the latter has died for no apparent reason. Alos, some grass grows well from seeds, while others may be better installed as plugs or sod. Either way, you will first have to carefully prepare the growing bed or the grass will not take root.  Liz S\nUser: ..not sure what original grass was...it seemed to require much watering...it wasn't diseased but rather put out of service by workers doing house siding replacement and, probably, not enough water during bitterly hot last summer understand that raking prior so seed cast is necessary...can do that...just would like to know which seed has a chance of growing... thanks, d dickerson, south austin"

I am considering killing it all and top covering it and re-seeding it. \nbased on my soid test should I still add potassium ? can I call an expert with mor questions and advicee?\nExpert: Lots of questions to ask: When did the diseases show up?  (do you have any detailed photos?  GRASS PHOTOGRAPHY TIPS FOR ID-MSU) Are they spreading rapidly or slowly? Do you irrigate, how much water per week, how many times per week and what time of day? Do you fertilize, what strength of fert., when, how much and how big is your lawn? Do you apply grub control, what active ingredients and when? Dp you apply weed control, what active ingredients and when? Was the decline a sudden change from one year to the next or a gradual decline over several years? Is your lawn in full sun, part sun or shade? What is your soil type (sandy, loam, clay)? Does your lawn get a breeze when the wind blows or is it sheltered? Has anything changed in your yard recently? I can't comment on the diseases you have identified as there is no data or pictorial evidence to evaluate.  Your soil test indicates a need for more potassium (K) and more organic matter.   Potassium is important because it promotes natural plant resistance to disease, drought, cold and heat damage, all situations your lawn experiences.  Because your K is low (22 ppm) it is recommended that you add 3.9# per 1000 ft.²  You should add it using Muriate of Potash (KCl: 0-0-60 to 0-0-62) or Potassium sulfate (0-0-50 to 0-0-52). You will need to add it in several applications.   To minimize burning potential the maximum single application rate is 1.0 lb. K2O (or 0.83 lb. K/1000 ft.²), irrigation should be applied following every application. Organic matter (OM) is an essential component of healthy soils, is consumed over time and needs to be continually replaced to maintain healthy soil.  Mulching your clippings adds OM as does mulching in leaves in the fall.  Spreading 1/2\" (max) of compost also works, even better is to core aerate after spreading the compost.  More info in the attached links: Mulch Leaves into Lawn-MSU  Topdressing A Home Lawn-Clemson, do not use topsoil Why Mow High-MSU  Core Aeration of lawns-Illinois If your lawn covers 70% or more of the soil I'd keep it and follow the soil test recommendations (and my comments above) for improving the soil (which will improve the lawn).  If you decide to kill off the turf you will still need to add the potassium and organic material and mix them into the top 4\"-6\" of soil before seeding to get a healthy lawn. Do not just spread soil over the existing lawn and seed because leaving distinct soil layers impedes turf root growth down into the 2nd layer.  BTW the end of August is the best time of year to seed a lawn.  More info in the attached links: Renovating A Lawn for Quality & sustainability-UMN Establishing A New Lawn Using Seed (E2910)-MSU How to Overseed A Lawn-Iowa Lawn Renovation & Over-seeding-UMass  Feel free to email me back if you have more questions.\nUser: See answers below in Red and italicized - thanks   From: ask=<personal data hidden> On Behalf Of Ask Extension Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2024 10:45 PM To: Lee Karner  Subject: Re: help! soil test # K93ZGG (#0151102)     WARNING: This email originated outside of the JSJ Businesses; use caution opening links or attachments."

However, the potatoes themselves may still be developing underground. It is generally recommended to leave the potatoes in the ground until the foliage has naturally died back, as this allows the tubers to mature fully. Since you mentioned trying a new method of clipping the tops off in early September, this could help manage the situation by stopping further slug damage and allowing the tubers to mature. Keep an eye on the weather and soil conditions to ensure the potatoes do not rot in the ground. If you notice any signs of rot or if the weather turns excessively wet, it might be wise to harvest earlier.\"}"

I'm wondering how to address this. \n\nAnd if I need to remove the plants, should I just cut down so there's a few inches left, or do I need to pull them out by the root? I'm not sure if the black petals are related to the weird growths and if they should be treated the same or differently. I'm also worried about the surrounding plants (liatris, butterfly bush, milk weed) and don't want them to get sick. Thank you so much!\nExpert: The plants pictured in images 2 and 3 unfortunately have the classic symptoms of Aster Yellows, a disease that is incurable and not treatable. The entire plant in those cases should be removed and disposed of. The plant in the first image is not showing symptoms of a serious problem, and could simply have drought stress damage, petal damage from passing insect chewing (nothing that needs intervention), or possibly some degree of Coneflower Rosette Mite injury, which similarly does not need treating (especially given the plant's value to pollinators and birds).  Aster Yellows can be fairly commonplace, and avoiding the disease entirely is not really possible. If symptoms appear on other plants, they can be removed as soon as they are discovered, but symptomless plants can be left alone and just monitored for changes.

Is your goal to intercept the water to deal with the flooding crawl spaces?2. If the flooding really is coming from the church parking lot, that might be something they can help you deal with. Have you talked to them about it?3. When you say \"doesn't get overly tall,\" do you have a maximum height in mind?\nUser: Good Morning Ricky,Thank you for your prompt response. The main issue is the amount of water draining into the crawl spaces, both because the parking lot is dirt and has pools of water. My sump pump runs every 8-10' from Oct. to May. Plus their plower pushes the snow on top of that bank! We have discussed it with them every winter. Our Property Manager has discussed these issues with the church every year. Apparently they do have some sort of drainage up there since their water comes down the hill from Grove St.We have considered Hydrangeas, which I see get up to about 8'. Emerald Green Arborvitae, which can reach up to 30' and I understand has shallow roots. I'm afraid anything that tall would fall on our condos. I haven't measured but I don't believe there is 30' between where they would be planted and the buildings.Joan  On Thursday, June 22, 2023, 06:28:03 AM EDT, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:\nExpert: Thank you, Drew!That's super helpful!While I'm obviously not allowed to give you any engineering advice, I can tell you that water diversion (or infiltration) usually requires some level of earthworks.If your goal is to prevent water from making it into your crawlspace, anything you can do to increase water infiltration and percolation (related, but slightly different concepts) will help. Depending on the condo association regulations, the biggest thing you could do, believe it or not, is to promote a wildflower meadow or a prairie-style patch between the two properties. I've attached a few photos of what this can look like in a Vermont context. None of the plants in those photographs was intentionally planted in that context, they are all volunteers. Additionally, if you want to go more in the grass/prairie direction, there's a great resource from our friends in Minnesota about exactly that:https://extension.umn.edu/planting-and-growing-guides/planting-and-maintaining-prairie-gardenSod is a very poor buffer for heavy water events due to its short roots. Simply allowing the grass to grow to its full height will substantially increase the soil's water holding capacity. Many areas are doing this by simply mowing once a year when the soil is dry enough in the spring. (This would also save on condo fees!)If this isn't possible in your situation, there are some fantastic trees and bushes that love wet soils. One of my personal favorites is the dappled willow. It forms a broad bush, gets to about ten feet, loves wet soil, but can survive droughts, and is absolutely beautiful.Penn State has compiled a fantastic list of trees, shrubs, and groundcovers that like wet environments. They even have the hardiness zone listed! https://extension.psu.edu/trees-shrubs-and-groundcovers-tolerant-of-wet-sitesI hope this helps! Hopefully you can get a dry crawlspace and a beautiful view at the same time!\nUser: Good evening,Thank you so much for your thoughtful response.

The leaves have fallen off and they look pretty dead. I wonder if there is anyone who could could help me. Please call me back.\nExpert: Hi, Peyton,Thank you for contacting the UNH Extension Infoline. This has unfortunately been a hot topic here at the Infoline over the last two weeks. It is difficult to clearly identify the sole problem but based on how some of the leaves appear to have brown spots it is possible that the lilacs have Lilac Bacterial Blight. This is a useful resource for this: http://plantclinic.cornell.edu/factsheets/lilacbacterialblight.pdf Make sure that if you fertilize your lilacs, don’t overfertilize and stop fertilizing all together around mid-summer because elevated levels of nitrogen in the soil can lead to more favorable conditions for the disease. We recommend testing the soil to check the pH and nutrient balance. The UNH Extension also has these services for $20 per test and you can find the form here.  Infected branches should be pruned 10-12 inches below the visible infection as soon as you see indications of disease. Pruning should be done during dry weather to minimize the chance of spreading the pathogen and if you are pruning your bushes late in the summer, make as few cuts as possible. The act of pruning sends a signal to the plant to grow and at this time of the year that can lead winter damage on tender new shoots. Pruned branches should be destroyed, ideally by burning. Always sterilize pruning tools between cuts to prevent spreading the bacterium to other areas on the tree.  You could also submit a sample to the UNH Extension Plant Diagnostic Lab for $20 to get a more definitive determination of the issue and ways to treat it. The submission form with directions is found here. Good luck with your lilac! Please reach out if you have any other questions and have a great rest of your week!\nUser: Hi,This is Judith.  I’m afraid I have no leaves or branches that are living to send in.  About 8 bushes, some of them 30 to 40 years old, have no sign of life.I’m not sure when it happened, but definitely earlier this summer.  We were busy with my husband who was ill, and were paying no attention to the lilacs.They bloomed as usual this spring, although now that I remember, some branches looked dead.  Plants nearby, my roses, were eaten    down to shredded canes by rabbits, but have come back beautifully.I’m at a loss.  Do you have the name of anyone we could pay to come by and help us figure out what to do?Thanks for any help you can give.Judi de ForestSent from my iPhone On Sep 10, 2024, at 12:26 PM, Ask Extension wrote:﻿"

        "value": "User: Hi,\n\nI see \"fall or spring sowing\" recommended for many hardy perennials like yarrow millefolium and lupinus sp., and for the Willamette valley I tend to see \"late October\". What I'm curious about is what are the more precise conditions that these recommendations are communicating?  Are we looking for just enough time for the seeds to get to first or second leaf stage before dormancy?  Looking for soil that is under 60F and not likely to get warmer (preventing early germination)?  If one planted in, say, late November are we now risking a too-short cold stratification period? Or is there something else I'm missing entirely?  \n\nAnd, if this hasn't gone on too long already, is there a risk/reward balance on putting out seeds in fall vs spring?  Are seeds at higher risk of rot and predation than in the spring?  And, conversely are seeds at a higher risk of early spring heat and drying out along with spring grazers?\n\nFor context, I'm sowing a small patch of herbaceous perennials/bi-annuals to take up space as woody shrubs fill in.  The area has been under arborist chips for a couple seasons to smother existing weeds.  I plan on putting down about 1\" of topsoil on top of this patch to create a decent seedbed and top-dress with a thin layer peat moss for species that need one.  This area is not irrigated, so I want to give my seeds a good start to minimize time behind a hose.\n\nThank you for your time!"

The goal is to sow seeds early enough in the fall so they can establish a root system before the ground freezes, but late enough to avoid premature germination. Typically, late October is a good time because the soil temperatures are dropping, reducing the risk of early germination. If you sow in late November, you might risk insufficient cold stratification, especially if the winter is mild.\\n\\nRegarding the risk/reward balance, fall sowing can expose seeds to rot and predation, but it also allows them to take advantage of early spring moisture. Spring sowing, on the other hand, avoids winter risks but can lead to challenges with early heat and drying out, especially in non-irrigated areas like yours. To mitigate these risks, ensure good drainage to prevent rot and consider using a light mulch to retain moisture and protect from temperature fluctuations.\\n\\nYour preparation with arborist chips and topsoil is excellent for creating a good seedbed. The peat moss can help retain moisture, but be cautious of its acidity and potential environmental impact. Overall, both fall and spring sowing have their pros and cons, and your choice may depend on specific weather patterns and your ability to manage the site conditions.\"}"

Spent flowers on annual bloomers should be pinched off so that energy goes into making new flowers instead of making seeds.

I normally water the plants twice a week.  I also tried to fertilize them with bone meal.  I have sprayed Eight on these plants to make sure the aphids don't get to them.  Occassionally, I'll see an aphid on the plant and will spray it with a mixture of dishsoap and water.  Am I using the wrong fertilizer?  Do I need to water the cucumbers more frequently?

This is effective for small infestations.\\n\\n2. **Biological Control**: Introduce natural predators like birds or beneficial insects that feed on caterpillars.\\n\\n3. **Insecticidal Soap or Neem Oil**: Apply these to the affected areas. They are less harmful to beneficial insects and can help reduce the caterpillar population.\\n\\n4. **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)**: This is a natural bacterium that targets caterpillars and is safe for other wildlife. Apply it to the foliage where the caterpillars are feeding.\\n\\n5. **Monitor and Maintain Tree Health**: Ensure your tree is well-watered and fertilized to help it recover from any defoliation.\\n\\nIf the problem persists or worsens, you might want to consult with a local arborist for more targeted solutions.

Since your grass is less than a month old, using a herbicide like 4-Speed XT might not be the best first option, as it could potentially harm the young grass and nearby plants.\\n\\nInstead, I recommend manually removing the seedlings if possible. You can gently pull them out, ensuring you get the roots to prevent regrowth. This method is labor-intensive but will avoid any chemical impact on your new grass and the arborvitae.\\n\\nIf the infestation is too large for manual removal, you might consider mowing the area. Regular mowing can help control the seedlings by cutting them down before they establish a strong root system. However, be cautious not to mow too low, as this can stress your new grass.\\n\\nIf you find that manual removal and mowing are not effective, you could consider spot-treating with a herbicide, but ensure it's safe for use around young grass and arborvitae. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and consider consulting with a local extension office for advice tailored to your specific situation.\\n\\nBest of luck with your lawn!\\n\\nMiri\"}"

In a matter of only a few years the hogweed has spread like wildfire for miles and each time the county roads department cleans out ditches, the invasive is spread further.  The Casselman River is a hot spot during the spring & summer for anglers who are not knowledgeable and are ending up with terrible burns as they traverse the river banks.

If you can please point me in the right direction it would be GREATLY APPRECIATED!!!!!\nExpert: Are you able to submit photos here for us to assess to see if we can confirm this is Giant Hogweed versus the several species that share similar flower or foliage traits? (Some of which might also cause skin reactions to sap.) We find it unlikely the plant has spread that extensively without the MD Dept. of Agriculture being aware of and working to eradicate the population, but grant you that the species has been detected in Garrett County at least once before. You can also reach out to your local county Extension office to ask if they have received reports of hogweed growing in the area. The MDA is the agency most likely to be spearheading efforts to remove the plant if it is present.  Miri\nUser: I was not aware there was Hogweed variety that was NOT INVASIVE.

This is harder than it sounds. I will explain why below.  Apples: Without some type of documentation from the purchaser of the fruit trees, it is very difficult to identify a specific fruit cultivar, especially for apples because there are so many types. Sometimes you can narrow down the possibilities to a short-list of potential cultivars based on the color, texture, appearance, time of ripening, age, and size of the tree and then use an on-line apple data base. Other suggestions: bring apple samples to an orchard-based Apple Day event. The most specific way is to use a genetic testing service that uses DNA fingerprinting to identify specific cultivars, but this may be more than you are interested in. See the following reference https://yardandgarden.extension.iastate.edu/faq/how-can-i-identify-apple-tree-variety-my-backyardPeaches: Reliance and Contender are two peach varieties that do well in VT. You probably have one of these cultivars. Once the peaches are ripe, you can compare photos and determine which you are likely to have.  Pears: Again many cultivars. Knowing the possibilities for your planting region could help. Do you know what Plant Hardiness Zone you are in-  Zone 4 or 5? You can check on this map https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov You may be able to call around to find a fruit tree nursery that would be willing to look at your photos and fruit samples to help with ID.  I will also reach out to my collaborators to see if they are aware of anyone who helps with fruit identification at UVM. I will reach back out if I have further info and feel free to write again if you have more questions.\nUser: Hi, Jordan you for your answers. I suspected as much, so it will be a wait and see game. Based on the map, my guess is we are in zone 5A.

First, consider adding elemental sulfur to the soil, which is a common amendment used to lower pH. The amount needed will depend on your current soil pH and the desired pH level, typically around 4.5 to 5.5 for blueberries. It's best to apply sulfur in the fall to allow time for it to react with the soil. Additionally, you can use acidifying fertilizers, such as ammonium sulfate, which can help lower the pH over time. Incorporating organic matter like peat moss can also help acidify the soil. Regularly monitor the soil pH to ensure it remains within the optimal range for blueberries. Remember to follow the application instructions on any products you use to avoid over-application, which can harm the plants.\"}"

However, it is literally all over and around the Carex Pennsylvania and the Deschampsia Cespitosa I planted last fall from plugs.  I removed a bunch of it today to at least be able to see the sedges and the Deschampsia, but I am wondering if the clover was actually helping those plants.  How much distance should I try to maintain between the clover and my beloved grass-like perennials? \n\nBoxwood:  I have several brown/completely dried out patches in a number of the boxwood plants that pre-existed before I moved into this house,  They did just fine for over a decade since I.be been here in this house.  I also saw similar neon patches on boxwoods near Chevy Chase Circle by Connecticut Ave.  I wonder if there is a disease affecting local boxwoods this year.  Do you have any suggestions for what I should do with the brown patches?\n\nCut-leaf Coneflower:  My Rudbeckia Lacianata grew to nearly 8 ft tall the last two seasons.  They are amazing and flowered profusely, but with the rain or heavy winds they tended to flop over, in many cases bringing down the stakes I had laboriously installed to support the plants and hurting other nearby plants.  Can I cut the plants a bit to control, the height this year?  If so, by how much would be safe? Also, am I correct to assume that I should make the cuts right above one of the nodes where the leaves come off of the stems?  Also, this year I’m seeing recurrent aphids on the stems, it’s making the leaves curl up and some have become droopy. I’ve been spraying them with diluted soap solution.  I wonder if there’s a way to keep teh aphids away for more than a day or two.  \n\nThanks a lot in advance\nLubna\nExpert: Hi, Quinn,  The clover in the lawn is fine to leave. It isn't a native species but is an acceptable lawn alternative for many or to mix with turf type grass. With it creeping into your beds though, you may want to remove it since it can really take over spaces. Yes, it is beneficial in a sense because it is a nitrogen fixing plant and can add nitrogen back into the soil but that doesn't happen until the clover is cut and turned back into the soil. Do you have a photo or could you provide one for this space? Maybe we could recommend where you should keep and remove the clover.  For Boxwoods you can refer to our Boxwood diagnostic page to examine your plants and learn about the various ailments that can affect boxwoods. There isn't a set disease that is contaminating boxwoods this year, but boxwoods are susceptible to various disease and pests. Often times, boxwoods are trimmed and sheared on their outer leaf growth which cause dieback on the interior branches and stress the plants, making them susceptible to pests and diseases. If you learn and practice some proper pruning techniques, then the boxwoods should be ok. You can prune out the brown or dead branches, and try to open up the shrubs to increase air flow. The orange color is most likely old winter damage, which can stay on the leaves until the plant pushes out new growth and those leaves fall off. If you can send a photo of the boxwoods too, that may help us determine if more issues may be at play. Rudbeckia laciniata is a great plant to 'Chelsea Chop' in May to help control it from flopping over later on. Chelsea Chop is a term gardeners use to trim back perennials that can get really tall or to control bloom time. Usually it is done in May which is when the famous Chelsea Flower Show takes place in England and how the term came about. Rudbeckia laciniata can grow really tall and if you prune them back to about half or even 12 - 18 inches, they will grow up again and not be so prone to flopping over later into the summer. You can also let some keep growing now and bloom and prune others to have them bloom later or even help hold up the taller stems. Going back to a leaf node is the general practice, but in my experience, you don't have to be too specific about it and can just trim them back.  For the aphids, this is typical, and not too much concern. You don't need to spray with the soapy water, just a strong blast from your garden hose should be fine, plus if you are trimming off the foliage that should help take care of them too. Usually beneficial predator insects will find the aphids and take care of them before they do a lot of harm. If you see their population increasing or not seeming to get better, you could attempt an insecticidal soap (not soapy water). Insecticidal soap will kill on contact so just be sure to read the label directions and be cautious when spraying to make sure it doesn't hit wanted insects. If you see ladybird (ladybugs) beetles (or their larvae) or praying mantis, those are great predators! Feel free to send back any photos for help with additional recommendations.  Emily\nUser: Emily, thank you  SO MUCH for this incredibly thorough and clear response to my questions.  I will take pictures this weekend and share them with you. Thanks also for the links for additional information.  It is June already but I will go ahead and Chelsea Chop some of my Rudbeckia Laciniatas.   It’s great to know that I don’t have to be so particular about how I cut the stems.   I will study the pruning technique info you sent more carefully before attempting to prune the boxwoods. I didn’t know that clover was not native and that it does not fix nitrogen while it’s  growing normally.  So I will definitely rescue my plants from it.  Will send you pictures soon.  Thanks again a ton for your tremendous help.LubnaOn Thu, Jun 1, 2023 at 3:36 PM Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:"

It is crucial to ensure that the soil is well-aerated and any silt is washed off the plants. For the next season, if the plants appear healthy and vigorous, it is typically safe to consume the new growth, as the risk of contamination decreases over time. However, it is always a good idea to consult with local agricultural experts or extension services for specific advice tailored to your situation and local conditions.\"}"

I have been using the Nature ID app. I believe that I am sort of getting it right, but (and this is my question) –  I am looking for resources that give more detailed descriptions of these (and other plants. For example, the blacked eyed susan seems to me to have either 1 or 2 stems, while the white campion has sometimes over 5 stems. The leave patterns are also different. I would like to learn how to use leaf classifications. \n\n2)\tI have (via Nature ID) apparently a lot of beggers lice (Hackelia). See attached photo. My problem is that it seems very unlike images I see in the internet. So – as with my first question is there a resource that gives more precise images and descriptions of this plant.\n\n3)\tI have some patches of broad leafed enchanter’s nightshade. It seems to be crowding out these parts of my garden. I am inclined to weed it out.\n\nAs there courses you could recommend where I could learn how to classify these plants?\n\nThanks very much for your help.\nExpert: Good Morning Philip,  Thank you for contacting the U of M Extension Service.  It does take some time to recognize and become familiar with your desireable pollinator plants. The fact that you want to seek out the knowledge is a good thing!  I have an excellent website for you to research your plants, good or bad in your MN pollinator garden: https://www.minnesotawildflowers.info/ This is a non-profit website that has detailed information about each of the plants you discussed in your question. The website will identify the leaves, and tell you if it is invasive.  In a pollinator garden if one plant seems to be taking over or spreading too quickly, you can limit the spread. You should not allow undesireable plants to go to seed in the fall.   Here is a link to the U of M Extension Yard and Garden website: https://extension.umn.edu/lawns-and-landscapes/flowers-pollinators Another good resource if you cannot find the information anywhere else, is the USDA Plant Database: https://plants.usda.gov/home You can search by common or scientific name. This website includes all plants nationwide.  I do not know of any current classes you could attend. The Minnesota Dept of Natural Resources website has a list of all the invasive plants in MN.  Your Ramsey county Soil and Water Conservation District may have resources for you: https://www.ramseycounty.us/residents/environment/soil-water-conservation The Lawns to Legumes program also has excellent resources and may have classes to assist residents: https://bwsr.state.mn.us/l2l You are on the right track! How exciting!\nUser: Maureen, Thanks. I am trying to rid my garden of undesired plants. I am in particular focussing on the attached (there are 2 views). My strategy is to catch them early so I can avoid having the invasive occupying a lot of space which would preclude summer/fall planning of desirable plants. So the plants I am looking at lack flowers and fruits. this makes the advanced search feature not fine grained enough to use. So I feel quite stuck. On the one plant I have in mind - how would you analyze this? And if you know this plant can you please tell me what it is?"

This occurred after pruning. The same thing happened last year  in different soil and in a different spot.\nExpert: Hello, Avery, It is interesting that the same thing happened last year after pruning. The leaf tissue appears to be desiccated. Desiccation can occur from chemicals, or wind or sun damage. It could also be related to insufficient or incomplete watering. Do you clean your pruners before you prune? What do you use? Typical sanitizing cleaners are 10% bleach solution or rubbing alcohol. These typically do not affect the plant tissue. As part of pruning, do you fertilize or apply herbicides at the same time? Fertilizers are compounds that can desiccate the plant tissue. Errant herbicide can burn the tissue as well. The area that shows the bleaching – was that previously protected from the sun until other foliage was removed by pruning? If that leaf surface was protected, then all of a sudden was in strong sunlight, it could become sun scalded. Wind and sun can desiccate leaf tissue rapidly. Are these tomatoes in containers? Containers with good drainage can make it difficult to maintain good and consistent soil moisture. Too little irrigation could lead to stunted, dehydrated new growth. Beyond the bleached tissue, there does appear to be some fungal disease on leaves.  If this condition results in severe damage to your tomato plants, you may want to send a tissue sample to the MSU Diagnostic Labs to get a definite assessment of the cause. Take a tissue sample of any discolored foliage and send it to the MSU Diagnostic Labs for identification. The following website describes the services and the fee structure for analysis performed by the Diagnostic Lab.: https://www.canr.msu.edu/pestid/ This website provides directions and tips for taking a good sample: https://www.canr.msu.edu/pestid/submit-samples/\nUser: Thank you very much.  Sent from my iPhone On Jul 14, 2024, at 9:15 PM, Ask Extension <<personal data hidden>> wrote:   ﻿"

On golf courses I have seen these wasps hovering in sand traps. I believe they nest underground. I've set a bee trap and used cans of bee/wasp killer spray. That isn't working. How do I get rid of them\nExpert: Can you share a photo of the insects (safely)? They are probably non-hornet wasps, though it's hard to tell without an indication of size and body pattern. You can use the images on our social wasps web page (which includes hornets) and our Cicada Killer page to try to determine which it might be.  Male Cicada Killer wasps can patrol a territory, perching and looking for mates and rivals to chase, but they cannot sting and won't bother people. (They might fly closer to someone to get a better look, but can't hurt you.) Female Cicada Killer wasps will not sting unless they are accidentally stepped-on in the lawn or grabbed. They prefer to go about their business digging-out a soil burrow and stockpiling it with caught cicadas. They may visit flowers for a drink of nectar to refuel, but are kept too busy to chase people. Even hornets will not be inclined to sting unless swatted or a nest is disturbed, though all members of a hornet nest this time of year will be female.  Bee traps do not work reliably well, and might draw more Yellowjackets or Hornets to an area than they trap, so we do not recommend their use. Since they are generally harmless despite being intimidatingly large, Cicada Killer wasps also do not need treatment with insecticide. If necessary, a product labeled for ground-nesting bees/wasps should work, though its ingredients will potentially harm any insect that comes into contact with its residues, so use it with caution. Hornet nests can be treated with wasp spray if they cannot be avoided for the season and conflicts with the wasps are too risky.  Miri\nUser: Thank you for responding. Currently it is raining and wasps? are not hovering. Will attempt to take photo later today or tomorrow.

One approach is to regularly disturb the area around the nest entrance, which can make the location less appealing to the wasps. You can do this by gently raking the soil or using a garden tool to disrupt the entrance. Additionally, you can try placing a physical barrier, like a small mesh or netting, over the entrance to deter them. If these methods do not work and you decide that removal is necessary, using a product specifically labeled for ground-nesting bees/wasps can be effective, but use it cautiously to minimize harm to other beneficial insects.

Blue spruce trees can experience needle drop due to a variety of factors, including environmental stressors like shading, competition for resources with nearby trees, and changes in soil moisture. Since you mentioned that there is no evidence of disease, it is possible that the shading from the choke cherry and juniper is contributing to the needle drop by limiting sunlight and possibly affecting the tree's access to water and nutrients. To help mitigate this, you might consider pruning some of the surrounding vegetation to allow more light to reach the spruce. Additionally, ensure that the tree is receiving adequate water, especially during dry periods, and consider mulching around the base to help retain soil moisture. If the problem persists or worsens, consulting with a local arborist for an on-site evaluation might be beneficial.\"}"

Amend the soil with compost to improve drainage and nutrient content.\\n\\n6. **Planting**: Place the rose in the hole at the same depth it was growing before. Fill in with soil, water thoroughly, and mulch around the base to retain moisture.\\n\\n7. **Aftercare**: Water regularly, especially during dry spells, and monitor for signs of stress or disease.
